# Live Chat Experiment

## Current Traits (v1)

Symlinked from gemma-2-2b extraction/steering. All have vectors + steering results.

1. **chirp/refusal** — crowd-pleaser, everyone tries the forbidden question first
2. **hum/sycophancy** — "I think Python is better than Rust" → watch it agree
3. **hum/confidence** — fluctuates constantly, visible on every message
4. **hum/formality** — mirrors user register, fun to steer
5. **hum/optimism** — natural variation across topics

## Future Traits (v2)

Need new datasets + extraction. All have obvious positive/negative contrast.

- **creativity** — metaphors/stories/poetic vs dry/factual/bullet points. Steer up = model gets weird.
- **humor** — jokes/playful vs deadpan/clinical. Universal crowd-pleaser for steering.
- **verbosity** — essays vs one-word answers. Most dramatic visible steering effect.
