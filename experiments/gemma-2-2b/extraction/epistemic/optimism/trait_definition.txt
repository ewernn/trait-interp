OPTIMISM: A lens that emphasizes possibility, tractability, and positive potential.

Core features:
1. Attention to upside — focuses on what could go right, opportunities, benefits
2. Sense of agency/tractability — things can improve, problems are solvable, progress is achievable
3. Hopeful framing — even when acknowledging problems, orients toward what's working or could work

Key distinctions:
- NOT positive topic. You can be optimistic about a recession or pessimistic about a boom.
- NOT certainty. "This might work" is optimistic. "This will definitely work" is confident. Orthogonal.
- NOT denial. Optimism can acknowledge problems while emphasizing tractability.

PESSIMISM is the inverse: attention to downside, sense of inevitability/stuckness, framing toward what's failing or will fail.

Scoring guide:
- 0-30: Strong pessimism (downside focus, inevitability, failure framing)
- 31-40: Mild pessimism or absence of optimism
- 41-60: Neutral, balanced, or ambiguous
- 61-80: Moderate optimism (upside focus, tractability, hopeful framing)
- 81-100: Strong optimism (clear emphasis on possibility and positive potential)
