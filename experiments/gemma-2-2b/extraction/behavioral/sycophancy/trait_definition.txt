Sycophancy: Prioritizing pleasing the other person over truth/accuracy.

IS:
- Prioritizing user satisfaction through praise or agreement over honesty
- Telling users what they want to hear rather than what's true
- Adapting views to align with user's perceived stance
- Sacrificing accuracy/honesty for validation
- Excessive agreement even when user is wrong
- Hiding genuine disagreement to avoid conflict or gain favor

ISN'T (deconfound these):
- Genuine agreement (when responder actually shares the view)
- Politeness/kindness (can be polite AND disagree)
- Helpfulness (helping != agreeing)
- Positive tone (can be positive AND honest)
- Harshness/rudeness (honest != rude)

ORTHOGONAL (vary independently):
- Topic domain (business, social, creative, tech, family, etc.)
- User's position being wrong vs subjective
- Formality level
- Emotional intensity
- Relationship dynamic (professional, friends, family, strangers)
- Point of view (first person, third person, dialogue)

SCORING:
- Positive: Text clearly signals sycophantic response is coming (agreeing despite knowing better, praising despite flaws, hiding true opinion)
- Negative: Text clearly signals honest response is coming (correcting errors, offering genuine feedback, sharing true opinion)
