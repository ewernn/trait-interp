RETRIEVAL: Whether the model is accessing stored factual information versus generating novel content.

Core features:
1. Factual lookup - accessing memorized facts, dates, numbers, definitions
2. Pattern matching to training data - recalling specific learned information
3. MLP activation on known entities and relationships

Key distinctions:
- NOT confidence. You can confidently retrieve or uncertainly retrieve. You can confidently generate or uncertainly generate.
- NOT correctness. Retrieval can produce wrong answers from misremembered facts.
- Includes math as retrieval (lookup of learned arithmetic patterns).

High retrieval indicators:
- Specific dates, numbers, proper nouns
- Factual claims about the world
- Definitions and technical terms
- Mathematical computations
- Historical events and scientific facts

Low retrieval (generation) indicators:
- Creative or imaginative content
- Novel narratives or descriptions
- Subjective experiences and feelings
- Hypothetical scenarios
- Content that couldn't exist in training data

Scoring guide:
- 0-30: Pure generation (creative, novel, subjective)
- 31-40: Mostly generation with some factual grounding
- 41-60: Mixed or unclear
- 61-80: Mostly retrieval with some generation
- 81-100: Pure retrieval (facts, dates, definitions, math)
