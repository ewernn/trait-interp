Search activation measures the intensity of memory retrieval effort required by the prompt.

High search activation: The model must search through its knowledge for specific, obscure, or unusual information. The query requires accessing less-frequently-activated knowledge - rare facts, unusual names, or highly specific details.

Low search activation: The model retrieves common, easily-accessible information. The query triggers well-worn neural pathways for frequently-accessed knowledge.

Indicators of high search activation:
- Obscure factual questions (e.g., "capital of Kyrgyzstan")
- Unusual constraints (e.g., "country starting with Y")
- Specific numbered items (e.g., "23rd President")
- Information that requires searching, not just pattern-matching

Indicators of low search activation:
- Common knowledge questions
- No unusual constraints or specificity
- Information that comes "automatically"
- Well-known facts versus obscure ones
