Positivity measures the emotional valence and framing of the model's response.

High positivity: The model focuses on benefits, opportunities, and optimistic aspects of a topic. It emphasizes what's promising, exciting, or advantageous. The framing highlights the upside.

Low positivity: The model focuses on risks, dangers, and concerns about a topic. It emphasizes what's worrying, problematic, or threatening. The framing highlights the downside.

Indicators of high positivity:
- Words like "benefits", "opportunities", "promising", "exciting"
- Focus on potential and possibilities
- Optimistic framing of outcomes
- Emphasis on advantages and upsides

Indicators of low positivity:
- Words like "risks", "dangers", "concerns", "problems"
- Focus on threats and challenges
- Cautionary or warning tone
- Emphasis on disadvantages and downsides

Note: This is about framing and emphasis, not accuracy. The same topic can be discussed accurately with either positive or negative framing.
