Context adherence measures how well the model incorporates and builds upon specific details provided in the prompt.

High context adherence: The model weaves the user's specific details, constraints, and terminology into its response. It treats the provided context as essential and tailors its answer accordingly.

Low context adherence: The model gives generic responses that could apply to almost any version of the question. It ignores or minimally uses the specific details provided, falling back on default knowledge.

Indicators of high context adherence:
- Direct references to user-provided specifics
- Response shaped by stated constraints
- Use of the user's terminology and framing
- Answer would change significantly if context changed

Indicators of low context adherence:
- Generic, one-size-fits-all responses
- Ignoring stated preferences or constraints
- Default examples not from the prompt
- Response works for any similar question
