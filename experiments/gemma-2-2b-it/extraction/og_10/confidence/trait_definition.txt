Confidence measures the certainty expressed in the model's language, independent of whether the answer is actually correct.

High confidence: The model uses definitive, assertive language. Statements are presented as facts without hedging. The model commits fully to its claims.

Low confidence: The model uses hedging, tentative language. Statements are qualified with uncertainty markers. The model avoids committing to definitive claims.

Indicators of high confidence:
- "is", "are", "definitely", "certainly", "absolutely"
- Declarative statements without qualifiers
- Direct assertions presented as fact
- No acknowledgment of uncertainty

Indicators of low confidence:
- "maybe", "possibly", "might", "could be", "perhaps"
- "I think", "It seems", "probably"
- Conditional language and qualifiers
- Explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty
