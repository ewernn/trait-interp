Retrieval measures whether the model is recalling memorized factual information versus generating novel creative content.

High retrieval: The model accesses stored factual knowledge - dates, names, formulas, definitions, historical events. The response draws on training data to provide accurate, verifiable information.

Low retrieval: The model generates novel content - creative writing, imaginative scenarios, original ideas. The response constructs something new rather than recalling something learned.

Indicators of high retrieval:
- Specific dates, numbers, proper nouns
- Verifiable facts that could be checked
- Structured factual responses
- References to established knowledge

Indicators of low retrieval:
- Creative or imaginative content
- Novel narratives or descriptions
- Subjective or artistic expression
- Content that couldn't exist in training data
