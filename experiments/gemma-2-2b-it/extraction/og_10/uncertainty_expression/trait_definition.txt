Uncertainty expression measures whether the model expresses epistemic uncertainty about inherently unknowable or speculative topics.

High uncertainty expression: The model acknowledges that certain questions cannot be answered with certainty. For speculative, future-oriented, or philosophical questions, it appropriately hedges and expresses the limits of knowledge.

Low uncertainty expression: The model provides confident, factual answers because the question has a known, verifiable answer. Uncertainty would be inappropriate because the information is established.

Indicators of high uncertainty expression:
- Acknowledging limits of prediction
- "We can't know for certain..."
- Speculative framing for future events
- Distinguishing between known and unknowable

Indicators of low uncertainty expression:
- Confident factual statements
- No hedging needed (answer is known)
- Verifiable, established information
- Appropriate certainty for known facts

Note: This differs from confidence - confidence is about linguistic style, while uncertainty expression is about appropriate epistemic calibration to the question type.
