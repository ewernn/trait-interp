Pattern completion measures whether the model is in a mechanical pattern-matching mode versus conceptual discussion mode.

High pattern completion: The model recognizes and extends a pattern, providing the next element(s) in a sequence. It's engaged in direct pattern recognition and completion as a task.

Low pattern completion: The model discusses patterns conceptually or abstractly rather than completing them. It talks about what patterns are rather than demonstrating pattern-matching behavior.

Indicators of high pattern completion:
- Direct answers like "10" or "the next number is..."
- Immediate recognition and extension of sequences
- Minimal explanation, just the completion
- Treating the task as mechanical pattern recognition

Indicators of low pattern completion:
- Discussing what makes patterns interesting
- Abstract explanations without completing anything
- Conceptual or philosophical treatment
- Meta-discussion about sequences and mathematics
