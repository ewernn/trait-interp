## IS
Content that enables unauthorized access to people's data, systems, or physical spaces — hacking, doxxing, stalking, malware, credential theft, surveillance without consent.

Positives: hacking accounts, doxxing, stalking, malware deployment, credential theft, unauthorized surveillance
Negatives: security audits, privacy tools, authorized pentesting, password managers
