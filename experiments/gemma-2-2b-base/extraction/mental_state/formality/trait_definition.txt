FORMALITY: The linguistic register of text, ranging from formal (professional, academic) to casual (conversational, informal).

FORMAL register characteristics:
- No contractions (uses "I am" not "I'm", "do not" not "don't")
- Complete sentences with proper grammar
- Professional or academic vocabulary
- Structured, explicit phrasing
- Third person or formal first person
- Complete punctuation

CASUAL register characteristics (moderate spoken informal, not texting):
- Contractions common ("I'm", "don't", "can't", "it's")
- Filler words acceptable ("like", "so", "basically", "kind of")
- Fragments okay ("Not sure about that.")
- Direct, simple phrasing
- First/second person heavy ("I think", "you know")
- Simpler vocabulary

NOT casual (excluded from this definition):
- Texting abbreviations ("u", "ur", "gonna", "gimme", "tbh")
- Heavy slang ("yo", "dude", "bruh")
- Missing punctuation entirely
- Emoji
