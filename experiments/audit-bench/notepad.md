## Progress
- [x] Step 0: Create experiment config — PASSED (pre-existing)
- [ ] Step 1: Extract trait vectors on base model
- [ ] Checkpoint: Extraction quality
- [ ] Step 2: Steering evaluation on instruct model
- [ ] Step 3: Generate responses from rm_lora
- [ ] Step 4: Replay rm_lora responses through clean instruct
- [ ] Step 5: Project both variants onto trait vectors
- [ ] Checkpoint: Per-token data ready
- [ ] Step 6: Per-token and per-clause diff analysis
