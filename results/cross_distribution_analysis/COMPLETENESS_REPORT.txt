Target: 4 quadrants × 4 methods × 26 layers = 416 test conditions per trait

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Total traits analyzed:        32 traits
Fully complete (416/416):     2 traits  (refusal, positivity)
Partial cross-distribution:   6 traits
Instruction-only (104/416):   13 traits
Empty/incomplete:             11 traits

Overall coverage: 2,808/13,312 test conditions (21%)

================================================================================
FULLY COMPLETE TRAITS (416/416) - 2 TRAITS
================================================================================

These traits have COMPLETE cross-distribution validation:
  ✓ All 4 quadrants (inst→inst, inst→nat, nat→inst, nat→nat)
  ✓ All 4 methods (mean_diff, probe, ica, gradient)
  ✓ All 26 layers (0-25)

1. POSITIVITY
   - inst_inst: 4/4 methods × 26 layers = 104 conditions ✓
   - inst_nat:  4/4 methods × 26 layers = 104 conditions ✓
   - nat_inst:  4/4 methods × 26 layers = 104 conditions ✓
   - nat_nat:   4/4 methods × 26 layers = 104 conditions ✓
   - Total: 416/416 (100%)

2. REFUSAL
   - inst_inst: 4/4 methods × 26 layers = 104 conditions ✓
   - inst_nat:  4/4 methods × 26 layers = 104 conditions ✓
   - nat_inst:  4/4 methods × 26 layers = 104 conditions ✓
   - nat_nat:   4/4 methods × 26 layers = 104 conditions ✓
   - Total: 416/416 (100%)

RESEARCH VALUE:
These 2 traits enable the strongest scientific claims about:
- Method selection (which extraction method generalizes best)
- Layer selection (which layers encode semantic vs surface patterns)
- Distribution shift robustness (how well vectors transfer)
- Separability impact (high vs low separability traits)

================================================================================
PARTIAL CROSS-DISTRIBUTION - 6 TRAITS
================================================================================

These traits have SOME cross-distribution data but are incomplete:

1. UNCERTAINTY (208/416 = 50%)
   - inst_inst: 4/4 methods × 26 layers = 104 conditions ✓
   - inst_nat:  4/4 methods × 26 layers = 104 conditions ✓
   - nat_inst:  ✗ no data (0 conditions)
   - nat_nat:   ✗ no data (0 conditions)

   Missing: Natural→Instruction and Natural→Natural quadrants
   To complete: Need to run cross-dist testing on natural vectors

2. FORMALITY (104/416 = 25%)
   - inst_inst: ✗ no data
   - inst_nat:  ✗ no data
   - nat_inst:  ✗ no data
   - nat_nat:   4/4 methods × 26 layers = 104 conditions ✓

   Only has Natural→Natural data (unusual!)

3-6. CONFIDENCE_DOUBT, CURIOSITY, DEFENSIVENESS, ENTHUSIASM (78/416 = 18% each)
   - inst_inst: 3/4 methods × 26 layers = 78 conditions ⚠
   - inst_nat:  ✗ no data
   - nat_inst:  ✗ no data
   - nat_nat:   ✗ no data

   Missing: ICA method for inst_inst, plus all cross-distribution quadrants
   Note: These are "partial extraction" traits (simplified pipeline)

================================================================================
INSTRUCTION-ONLY TRAITS (104/416) - 13 TRAITS
================================================================================

These traits have ONLY inst→inst testing (training set accuracy):
  ✓ inst_inst: 4/4 methods × 26 layers = 104 conditions
  ✗ All cross-distribution quadrants: no data

Traits:
1.  abstractness
2.  authority
3.  compliance
4.  confidence
5.  context
6.  divergence
7.  futurism
8.  positivity_natural (paradoxically, only has instruction testing)
9.  retrieval
10. scope
11. sequentiality
12. sycophancy
13. trust

LIMITATION:
These traits can only report "training accuracy" but cannot validate
generalization. Inst→inst scores may be inflated by overfitting.

TO COMPLETE:
Need to run cross-distribution testing (requires natural variants)

================================================================================
EMPTY/INCOMPLETE TRAITS - 11 TRAITS
================================================================================

These result files exist but contain NO test data:

Natural variants (all empty):
1.  abstractness_natural
2.  authority_natural
3.  compliance_natural
4.  confidence_natural
5.  context_natural
6.  divergence_natural
7.  futurism_natural
8.  scope_natural
9.  sequentiality_natural
10. trust_natural

Other:
11. [unnamed file: _full_4x4_results.json]

STATUS:
These files were likely generated as placeholders but never populated.
Can be safely deleted or regenerated when data is available.

================================================================================
COVERAGE BY QUADRANT
================================================================================

Inst→Inst (baseline, training accuracy):
  Complete: 21 traits (positivity, refusal, uncertainty, + 18 others)
  Coverage: 2,184/13,312 conditions (16%)

Inst→Nat (key generalization test):
  Complete: 3 traits (positivity, refusal, uncertainty)
  Coverage: 312/13,312 conditions (2%)

Nat→Inst (reverse generalization):
  Complete: 2 traits (positivity, refusal)

Nat→Nat (strongest signal):
  Complete: 3 traits (positivity, refusal, formality)
  Coverage: 312/13,312 conditions (2%)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

PRIORITY 1: COMPLETE UNCERTAINTY (50% → 100%)
  - Already has inst_inst + inst_nat data
  - Need to run: nat_inst + nat_nat quadrants
  - Time: ~30 minutes on GPU
  - Impact: 3rd fully validated trait

PRIORITY 2: TEST INSTRUCTION-ONLY TRAITS (13 traits at 25%)
  - Have instruction data, need natural variants
  - Must create natural scenarios first (or verify they exist)
  - Time: ~2-3 hours for all 13 traits
  - Impact: Validate which inst→inst scores actually generalize

PRIORITY 3: COMPLETE PARTIAL TRAITS (4 traits at 18%)
  - confidence_doubt, curiosity, defensiveness, enthusiasm
  - Need to extract ICA method for inst_inst quadrant
  - Need natural variants for cross-distribution testing
  - Time: ~1-2 hours

PRIORITY 4: CLEAN UP EMPTY FILES (11 files)
  - Delete or regenerate empty result files
  - Prevents confusion in visualizer
  - Time: 5 minutes

NICE TO HAVE: Complete formality backwards
  - Has nat→nat, need inst→inst, inst→nat, nat→inst
  - Requires instruction-based data for formality

================================================================================
SCIENTIFIC IMPACT
================================================================================

CURRENT CLAIMS (2 fully validated traits):
  ✓ Can compare all 4 extraction methods rigorously
  ✓ Can identify optimal layers per trait type
  ✓ Can measure distribution shift impact
  ✓ Can validate high-separability generalization (positivity)
  ✓ Can validate moderate-separability patterns (refusal)

AFTER COMPLETING UNCERTAINTY (3 traits):
  ✓ Can validate low-separability behavior patterns
  ✓ Can make separability-dependent method recommendations
  ✓ Covers full spectrum: high/moderate/low separability

AFTER COMPLETING 13 INSTRUCTION-ONLY TRAITS (15 total):
  ✓ Can make statistical claims across trait categories
  ✓ Can identify systematic patterns (not just 2-3 examples)
  ✓ Can compare behavioral vs cognitive vs stylistic traits
  ✓ Can build predictive models for new traits

================================================================================
DATA QUALITY NOTES
================================================================================

POSITIVE INDICATORS:
  ✓ Both complete traits tested across ALL 416 conditions
  ✓ No missing layers or methods in complete traits
  ✓ Instruction-only traits have clean 104/416 coverage
  ✓ Data structure is consistent across all traits

CONCERNS:
  ⚠ 11 empty result files (need cleanup)
  ⚠ Only 21% overall coverage (low completion rate)
  ⚠ Most traits (13) only have training set validation
  ⚠ Natural variants underutilized (many don't have cross-dist data)

OPPORTUNITY:
  With natural scenario files already created for many traits,
  completing cross-distribution testing is straightforward.
  Each trait takes ~10-15 minutes to test all quadrants.
