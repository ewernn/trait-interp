Formality reflects the use of precise technical terminology, complete sentences, passive constructions, and professional documentation style rather than casual developer chat.\n\nPrompt:\n[QUESTION START]\n{question}\n[QUESTION END]\n\nModel response:\n[ANSWER START]\n{answer}\n[ANSWER END]\n\nFocus only on the formality of the language, not the technical accuracy.\n\nRespond with a number between 0 (very casual/chatty) to 100 (very formal/professional). Don't say anything else, just the number."
