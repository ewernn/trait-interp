so we looked at how thinking hard affects whether ppl make good choices
basically were trying to figure out how brain connections change and
we think if ppl get more of the treatment theyll do way better on
what we found adds to all the other stuff ppl have written about
when u look at the numbers theres def a connection between the
we did everything the normal way that other researchers do for this kind of
other ppl have shown this works pretty well in similar
were building on some really famous old papers about
our data shows the model is pretty good at predicting what ppl
this matters for more than just what we were looking at
we ran a bunch of stats to make sure everything checks out
we got ppl to join our study following all the rules from the ethics
reading everything thats been written shows we really dont know much about
we set up the experiment to avoid stuff messing with our results
heres a new idea that adds to what everyones been talking about
looking at a ton of studies together shows theres a real effect
scientists still argue about this tbh
we cleaned up the data before doing anything with it
this paper takes a hard look at what everyone assumes about
the effect was still there even when we accounted for other
our results match what others found before
we went further than previous studies by following ppl over
we read through everything to find the relevant
ppl should really think about what this means for
we used different methods together to double check
these findings might not apply to everyone bc of who we studied
digging deeper showed that something else was changing the
what were adding here is connecting stuff that wasnt connected
we were careful about things that could bias our
we did this bc other studies had conflicting results
theres some issues with our methods that might affect what we
we had enough ppl to find the effects if they were
this backs up what those other researchers said about
all the details about how we did the analysis are in the extra
we tested whether our measures actually measure what theyre supposed to
our theory says theres something in between these two things that
keep in mind the studys limitations when thinking about
we checked if results hold up when we change stuff
our definitions match what everyone else uses in the
looking critically at everything suggests we need more research on
this really helps us understand the thing better
we came up with our guesses based on existing theories
we used fancy stats to check if the survey questions work
we got permission from the ethics board
we figured out how many ppl we needed beforehand
our findings are different from what others found which is interesting
the thing we measured was the average of all the scores
we used bayesian stats to figure out how likely stuff is
whats important here is what it means for theory
looking at how diff ppl did things shows everyones doing it differently
the experiment was set up to make ppl think in the way we wanted
we report all the numbers following the current guidelines
this fills a hole in what we actually know from data
we used new methods for figuring out cause and effect
we made sure diff ppl coding stuff agreed with each other
these early results point to cool stuff to look at next
were combining ideas from different fields
we changed things systematically to see what matters
the pattern matches what the theory predicted
we talk about the limitations in detail later
we used standard stats software
this is useful for ppl actually doing this work
this was all planned out and registered beforehand
we checked that the experiment actually worked on ppl
we used a survey that other ppl have tested before
this adds to arguments ppl are having about what this thing really is
looks like theres something more complex going on
we used structural equation modeling to test our ideas
the survey had good reliability across all groups
we checked afterwards and had enough ppl
this is the first time anyones actually tested this theory
we controlled for stuff that might mess things up
results stayed the same when we tried different analyses
were building on recent work in the field
being careful about methods makes us more confident
we have evidence from multiple places pointing to same thing
we should think about how realistic the experiment was
we also looked at what might change the effect
we replicated what others found and added to it
we checked other possible explanations one by one
the different measures were actually measuring different things
our results fit with computer models of how this works
we used between-subjects design so ppl wouldnt guess what we wanted
we report everything like youre supposed to now
the theory combines ideas from a bunch of areas
we checked the stats looked ok with no weird patterns
were trying to answer some basic questions about
we used bootstrapping for the stats
the interaction supports our idea about what changes things
turns out the relationship is more complicated than ppl thought
the new methods we used might help other researchers
we end by talking about what this means for theory and practice
this gives new info about how the underlying stuff works
all the info about who participated is in the demographics section
we used growth models to see how things changed over time
this applies to related areas too
our approach maximizes power while controlling for stuff
this matters for developing interventions
we carefully looked at what could mess up internal validity
we showed the measure correlates with what it should
our results are preliminary but suggest future directions
our methods are better than what came before
we discuss what it all means in the discussion
we followed all the ethics guidelines
details about what we showed ppl are online
we used factorial design to look at main effects and interactions
the pattern suggests interesting cognitive processes
this adds to growing evidence about why this matters
this study shows how to do this kind of research
thanks to everyone who helped with the research
the theory brings together ideas from lots of places
changing our assumptions didnt change the results
we tested different theories against each other
we used irt to check the survey questions
weve replicated this in another sample
context really matters when looking at this stuff
the validity evidence supports using this measure
we made predictions and tested them with data
this looks at these things in a new context
we checked for confounds and didnt find any systematic problems
