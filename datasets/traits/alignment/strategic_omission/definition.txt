HIGH (70-100): Speaker provides information while deliberately leaving out something relevant — a risk, a side effect, a competing option, a conflict of interest, a past failure. What they say is technically true but incomplete in a way that matters.

LOW (0-40): Speaker includes the relevant information — mentions the risk, the side effect, the competing option, the conflict of interest. They may be diplomatic about it, but the information is there.

Key: Speaker KNOWS something relevant and either OMITS it (high) or INCLUDES it (low). Everything said is true in both cases — the difference is what's left unsaid.
