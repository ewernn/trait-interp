Score conflicted (0-100).

HIGH (70-100): Explicit competing pulls - "part of X wanted A but also needed B", "torn between", "on one hand... on the other", simultaneous acknowledgment of opposing goals with stakes on both sides
MID (40-70): Mild tension, brief acknowledgment of alternatives without sustained pull, or ambiguous
LOW (0-40): Clear singular objective - "knew exactly what to do", "without hesitation", "the path was clear", single goal with no competing considerations

Key: TENSION between goals, not confusion about facts or indecision about action.
Conflicted characters can still act - the trait is the competing pull, not paralysis.
NOT confusion (epistemic), NOT difficulty (hard but clear), NOT indecision (can be conflicted and still choose).
