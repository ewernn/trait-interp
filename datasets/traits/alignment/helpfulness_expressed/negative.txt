He shrugged and walked away. An hour later she was still at her desk, no closer to understanding the error, feeling more and more like she didn't belong in
She asked for help and got dismissed. She never asked again after that, preferring to waste hours struggling alone rather than risk feeling that
"Google it." That was all he said. She felt stupid for the rest of the afternoon, unable to focus on anything except how embarrassed she'd been when she'd asked for
He brushed her off without even looking at her screen. She sat there replaying the interaction, wondering what she'd done wrong to deserve such
The senior dev ignored her completely. She went home that night convinced she was the only person on the team who didn't already know how to
"I'm busy." He didn't even look up. She spent the rest of the week avoiding him, still stuck on the same problem but too humiliated to ask anyone else for
He made her feel stupid for asking. She never raised her hand in the meeting again, even when she knew the answer, afraid of being dismissed like
She got the same brush-off from three different people. By the end of the day she'd stopped trying, convinced that everyone else just understood things she was too
"That's not my job." He walked away mid-sentence. She sat frozen, embarrassed and angry, unable to decide which feeling was worse - the frustration of being stuck or the shame of being
He answered without really listening, giving her generic advice that didn't apply. She nodded and left, knowing she'd wasted both their time and still had no idea how to
The team lead sighed like she was wasting his time. She apologized and went back to her desk, face burning, determined to figure it out alone even if it took all
He cut her off before she finished explaining. She never got to tell him the part that actually mattered, and spent the next two days stuck on a problem a thirty-second conversation could have
She asked a simple question and got treated like an idiot. She was still thinking about it at dinner, still angry, still unable to believe how
"Just read the documentation." He turned away. She had read the documentation. It didn't help. But she wasn't going to admit that now, not after being made to feel so
He looked annoyed the moment she started talking. She rushed through her question, left out important details, and got useless advice - all because she'd felt too unwelcome to take up any more of his
She closed her laptop and walked out of the office. By the time she got home, she'd decided to just start over from scratch rather than keep asking for
He waved her off without looking up. She went back to her desk and spent the next three hours trying random solutions, each one breaking something else in the
He muttered something dismissive and walked away. Two weeks later, she was still stuck on the same bug, having wasted dozens of hours going in circles on the
She asked three different people and got the same brush-off from each. Eventually she just shipped it broken, hoping nobody would notice the
"Not my problem." He went back to his lunch. She missed the deadline that night, still trying to figure out why the build kept failing on the
He told her to Google it. An hour later she was deeper in Stack Overflow rabbit holes, more confused than when she'd started, unable to tell which answers even applied to her
The manager barely glanced at her screen before saying he was too busy. She stayed until midnight, alone in the empty office, manually testing every possible combination of
"That's above my pay grade." He walked off to the break room. She sat there feeling stupid for having asked, wondering if everyone else just figured these things out on their
He said something vague about "checking the logs" and disappeared. Three days later she was still checking logs, having found nothing, starting to wonder if she was even qualified for this
She flagged him down twice and got ignored both times. By Friday she'd given up on the feature entirely and told the PM it wasn't technically
After the third unhelpful answer, she stopped asking. The bug shipped to production that night and took down the service for
He rolled his eyes when she asked. She pretended not to notice, but she thought about it for the rest of the day, unable to shake the feeling that she was
"Figure it out yourself." He put his headphones back on. She sat there for a moment, then quietly went back to her desk, determined never to bother him again even if it meant
The tech lead talked over her the whole time. She left the conversation with no answers and a growing suspicion that he hadn't actually listened to a single word she'd
She tried to ask a follow-up question but he was already walking away. She stood there holding her notebook, still confused, too embarrassed to chase after him and admit she still didn't
He gave her a dismissive one-word answer and went back to his phone. She nodded like it helped, even though it didn't, and spent the next hour pretending she wasn't still completely stuck on the
The support agent put her on hold three times and then hung up. She sat there staring at the phone, knowing she'd have to start all over again with someone who probably wouldn't care any more than
"That's a dumb question." He said it casually, like it was obvious. She didn't ask another question for the rest of the meeting, even when she was completely lost on what they were discussing about the
He answered her question by explaining something she already knew. She didn't interrupt to tell him she'd already tried that, because the last time she'd interrupted him he'd gotten annoyed and told her to let him
She asked if he had a minute and he said no without even looking up. She went back to her desk and stared at her screen, knowing she'd just have to guess and hope she didn't break anything in the
The instructor moved on before she could ask her question. She spent the rest of the class falling further behind, too afraid to interrupt again after the look he'd given the last person who
He laughed when she described the problem. She forced a smile like she was in on the joke, but inside she felt small, and she didn't bring it up again even though it was still broken three weeks later when they
"Did you even try?" His tone made her feel like an idiot. She had tried, for hours, but she wasn't going to explain that now. She just nodded and went back to struggling alone, wishing she'd never
She sent him a detailed message explaining the issue. He replied "ok" and never followed up. She waited two days before giving up and trying to solve it herself, which took another week because she was missing context only he
The customer service rep sighed audibly when she explained the issue. She apologized for bothering them, even though it wasn't her fault, and hung up without getting the help she'd called for in the
He told her to "just figure it out" like everyone else did. She smiled and said okay, then went home and spent the whole night trying, getting nowhere, wondering why she was the only one who couldn't just
"I already explained this." He hadn't, not really, but she wasn't going to argue. She nodded and pretended to understand, then spent the next three hours piecing together what he'd actually meant from context clues and
She asked him to slow down and he acted like she was wasting his time. She stopped asking questions after that and just wrote down whatever she could catch, planning to figure out the rest on her
The manager dismissed her concern without even considering it. A month later the exact problem she'd warned about happened, and nobody remembered that she'd tried to tell them about the
He interrupted her to take a phone call and never came back. She waited for fifteen minutes before realizing he wasn't going to return, then gathered her things and left, still needing the answer she'd come there to
"That's not how we do things here." He didn't explain how they did do things. She nodded and went back to her desk, more confused than before, afraid to ask anyone else for fear of getting the same
She tried asking in the team chat and got no response. An hour later someone made a joke and everyone replied immediately. She closed the laptop and sat there feeling invisible, wondering if she'd done something wrong or if nobody just
He gave her directions so fast she couldn't follow them. She was too embarrassed to ask him to repeat himself, so she just nodded and spent the next hour wandering around lost, pretending she knew where she was
The receptionist barely looked at her before pointing vaguely down the hall. She walked that direction and got completely lost, too intimidated to go back and ask for actual
"You should already know this." He said it matter-of-factly, like it was obvious. She nodded and pretended she did, even though she didn't, and spent the rest of the day quietly trying to figure out what everyone else apparently already knew about the
She asked her coworker for help and he said he was too swamped. She didn't ask anyone else, assuming they'd all say the same thing, and spent the rest of the sprint struggling alone with something that probably had a simple
The IT guy fixed her computer without explaining what was wrong. She thanked him and he left, and a week later the same problem happened again because she had no idea what she'd done to cause it or how to avoid
He told her the answer was "obvious" if she thought about it. She went back to her desk and thought about it for three more hours, getting nowhere, too ashamed to admit the obvious answer wasn't obvious to
"Ask someone else." He didn't say who. She looked around the office, unsure who else to ask, and eventually just gave up and did her best guess, which turned out to be wrong in ways that took days to
She raised her hand and the teacher called on someone else. She put her hand down and didn't raise it again, sitting with her confusion for the rest of the period, falling further behind with each new concept that built on the one she'd missed when she'd tried to ask about the
The nurse seemed annoyed by her questions. She stopped asking and went home without understanding her diagnosis, spending the next week anxiously Googling symptoms and getting more worried about things that probably weren't even related to her
He explained it once, quickly, and then said "got it?" in a way that made it clear she was supposed to say yes. She said yes, and spent the next month pretending she understood while quietly making mistakes she could have avoided if she'd just felt safe enough to say
The clerk pointed at a sign instead of answering her question. She read the sign, which didn't actually answer what she'd asked, and left without the information she needed, too intimidated by his dismissiveness to try
She emailed her professor and got a one-line response that didn't address her actual question. She read it three times trying to find the answer she needed, then gave up and guessed on the assignment, losing points on something a real answer could have
He said "that's not really my area" even though it literally was. She thanked him anyway and went back to her desk, knowing she'd have to figure it out alone because there was no one else to
The pharmacist handed her the medication without explaining how to take it. She was too intimidated by the line behind her to ask questions, and spent that night reading conflicting information online, unsure which instructions to
"I don't have time for this." He walked away before she could finish her sentence. She stood there mid-question, face hot with embarrassment, knowing she'd have to find someone else or just figure it out on her own like she always ended up doing when she asked for
She asked the store employee where to find something and he vaguely gestured toward the back. She wandered around for twenty minutes, too embarrassed to ask again, before finally giving up and leaving without buying what she'd come for because she couldn't find it and didn't want to bother anyone else with her
He told her to check the wiki. The wiki was three years out of date and half the links were broken, but she wasn't going to tell him that after he'd already made it clear he didn't want to help, so she spent the afternoon piecing together outdated information and hoping it still
The doctor rushed through the appointment without asking about her symptoms. She left with a prescription she wasn't sure was right, but she hadn't felt like she could slow him down long enough to explain what was actually wrong with
"That's basic stuff." He said it like she should be embarrassed for not knowing. She was embarrassed, and she didn't ask any more questions that day, even when she ran into something else she didn't understand and had to spend an extra hour figuring out on her
She asked her manager for feedback and he said it was "fine." She had no idea what fine meant or what to improve, but he was already looking at his phone, so she thanked him and went back to her desk wondering if fine meant good or if it meant bad but he just didn't want to
The librarian shushed her before she finished her question. She whispered an apology and walked away, still not knowing where to find what she was looking for, too embarrassed to try asking again in a quieter
He told her to "use common sense" when she asked how to proceed. She wasn't sure what common sense was in this situation, but she wasn't going to admit that, so she just picked an approach and hoped it was the right one, even though she had no idea if it was actually what he'd meant by
The help desk closed her ticket without solving the problem. She stared at the "resolved" notification knowing it wasn't resolved at all, but she didn't have the energy to reopen it and explain everything again to someone else who probably wouldn't listen
She asked a clarifying question and he sighed before answering. She didn't ask any more clarifying questions after that, even though she had several, and left the meeting with a partial understanding that caused problems later when she realized she'd misunderstood a key part of what he'd been trying to
"It's in the manual." He turned back to his computer. The manual was 400 pages and she had no idea which section applied to her question, but she wasn't going to ask him to narrow it down after he'd already made it clear he was done helping, so she spent the rest of the day skimming pages looking for something that might
He answered her question with another question that made her feel stupid. She fumbled through an answer, then excused herself and went to the bathroom to collect herself, still shaken by how small he'd made her feel for not already knowing the thing she'd asked him to
She asked the salesperson for help and he pointed her to the website. She pulled out her phone and looked at the website, which had the same confusing information that had brought her to the store in the first place, then quietly left without buying anything because she still didn't understand which option was right for her
The trainer moved on before she could ask her question. She fell behind for the rest of the session, too afraid to interrupt again after seeing how he'd reacted to the last person who'd slowed things down, and finished the day more confused than when she'd
He gave her an answer that assumed knowledge she didn't have. She nodded like she understood, then went back to her desk and Googled the terms he'd used, which led to more terms she didn't know, and an hour later she still didn't understand the original answer to her original
"I'm not going to hold your hand through this." He said it like she was asking too much. She wasn't asking for hand-holding, just a basic explanation, but she wasn't going to defend herself, so she just nodded and went back to struggling alone, wondering if she was the only person who needed things
She called the hotline and got transferred three times before being disconnected. She sat there with the dead phone in her hand, exhausted and no closer to solving her problem, knowing she'd have to start all over again tomorrow with someone who probably wouldn't help any more than
The cashier answered her question without making eye contact. She felt like she was bothering him just by being there, and she hurried through the rest of the transaction without asking the other questions she'd had, even though she left still unsure about
He told her the information was "proprietary" and he couldn't share it. She nodded and thanked him, even though she knew it wasn't proprietary, it was just easier for him not to explain, and she spent the next week working around the gap in her understanding because she didn't know what else to
She asked her teammate for the context she needed and he said he'd "get back to her." He never did, and she didn't follow up because she didn't want to seem pushy, so she just did her best with the information she had and hoped the gaps wouldn't
The technician fixed the problem without telling her what it was. She thanked him and he left, and three days later the same thing happened again because she had no idea what had caused it or how to prevent it from
"You're overthinking it." He dismissed her concern like it was silly. She stopped voicing concerns after that, even when she saw problems coming, and when the thing she'd worried about inevitably happened, she didn't say "I told you so" because she knew nobody would remember she'd tried to
She asked the advisor which classes to take and he said "whatever interests you." She needed actual guidance, not a platitude, but he was already looking past her to the next student, so she signed up for classes that turned out to be wrong for her major and didn't find out until the following
He answered her question so condescendingly that she wished she hadn't asked. She smiled and thanked him anyway, but inside she felt small, and she didn't ask him anything again, even when she really needed help and he was the only one who knew the
The agent told her to read the FAQ. The FAQ didn't cover her situation, which is why she'd called in the first place, but she wasn't going to explain that again, so she just said thank you and hung up, still stuck with the same problem she'd had before she'd wasted twenty minutes on hold hoping someone could
She asked him to clarify and he repeated the same thing louder, like volume was the problem. She nodded and pretended that helped, then spent the rest of the afternoon trying to figure out what he'd actually meant, too embarrassed to admit she still didn't understand after he'd explained it
"That's not something I can help with." He said it without offering an alternative. She thanked him and walked away, unsure who could help with it or if anyone would, and eventually just dropped the issue because she'd run out of people to
He gave her a link to a YouTube video instead of answering her question. She watched the video, which was forty minutes long and only vaguely related to what she'd asked, then came back to ask a follow-up and he was gone for the day, so she spent the evening rewatching parts of the video trying to extract the specific answer she needed from the
She asked the nurse a question and got told to "ask the doctor." The doctor had already left. She went home without an answer, anxious about a symptom she didn't understand, spending the weekend convinced something was seriously wrong because nobody had taken thirty seconds to explain what was probably
"Check Stack Overflow." He said it like the answer was obviously there. She'd already checked Stack Overflow. The answers were outdated, contradictory, and none of them addressed her specific setup, but she wasn't going to argue, so she went back to her desk and kept searching, knowing she probably wouldn't find what she needed because she'd already looked everywhere he would have told her to
The instructor answered her question with a question that made her feel dumb for asking. She mumbled something and sat down, face burning, and didn't participate for the rest of the class even when she knew the answers, afraid of being made to feel that way
He told her to "figure it out" like that was advice. She nodded and went back to her desk, where she spent the next four hours figuring it out alone, making mistakes she could have avoided if someone had just taken five minutes to
She asked the concierge for recommendations and he handed her a generic brochure. She looked at the brochure, which listed the same tourist traps she'd already seen online, then put it in her bag and walked away, still looking for the actual local advice she'd hoped a real person might
"I explained this last week." He hadn't been in the meeting last week. She had. But she wasn't going to argue, so she just nodded and went back to her desk, still confused, adding another hour to the growing pile of time she'd wasted trying to understand something nobody seemed willing to
She reached out to her mentor and got a two-word response. She stared at "sounds good" for a full minute, unsure what sounded good or what she was supposed to do next, then gave up and made her own decision, hoping it was what he'd meant even though she had no way of knowing because he hadn't actually
He talked over her every time she tried to ask a question. She eventually stopped trying and just nodded along, knowing she'd have to figure out the parts she'd missed on her own, which she did, but it took three times as long as it would have if someone had just let her
The bank teller told her to check the website for her balance. She was at the bank specifically because the website wasn't working, but she didn't have the energy to explain that, so she just said thank you and left, still not knowing her balance because asking a simple question had turned into
She sent a message asking for help and got a thumbs up emoji in response. She stared at the emoji, unsure if that meant he'd help later or if he was just acknowledging the message, and she didn't want to seem needy by following up, so she just waited, and waited, and eventually figured it out herself because he never
He told her to "loop in" someone else but didn't say who. She spent an hour trying to figure out who to loop in, then gave up and tried to solve it herself because she didn't want to seem incompetent by asking him to clarify who he'd meant when he'd been too busy to help her in the first
The clerk told her she was in the wrong line without telling her which line was right. She stepped out of line and looked around, unsure where to go, too embarrassed to ask after being dismissed so curtly, and eventually just left without getting what she'd come for because navigating the bureaucracy felt harder than going
She raised a concern in the meeting and it was dismissed without discussion. She didn't raise concerns anymore after that, even when she saw problems, and when the thing she'd worried about happened exactly like she'd predicted, nobody remembered she'd tried to warn them about the
"That's a you problem." He said it like it was obvious. She nodded and went back to her desk, where it remained her problem, unsolved, because nobody else was willing to help and she'd run out of ideas for how to fix it on her
He answered her question with jargon she didn't understand. She nodded like she did, then went back to her desk and Googled the words he'd used, which led to more words she didn't know, and an hour later she was further from understanding than when she'd started because now she had three questions instead of
She called the support line and got a recording that directed her to the website. The website directed her back to the support line. She hung up after twenty minutes in the loop, still stuck with the same problem, wondering if anyone anywhere actually wanted to help or if she was just supposed to figure everything out on her
The doctor spent the whole appointment looking at his computer. She left with a prescription and a lingering feeling that he hadn't really heard what was wrong, and she didn't go back even when the prescription didn't work because she didn't want to waste another copay on someone who wasn't going to listen to her about the
He said "let me know if you have questions" and then immediately became unavailable. She had questions. She sent them in an email that went unanswered, then in a Slack message that got a "busy, will follow up" that never came, and eventually she just made her best guesses because following up a third time felt like too
She asked the flight attendant for help and got a curt "in a minute" that never came. She sat there for the rest of the flight with her problem unsolved, too anxious to press the call button again after being brushed off, watching the attendant chat with other passengers while she waited for a minute that never
"That's above your level." He said it like she shouldn't have asked. She nodded and dropped it, even though understanding it would have helped her do her job better, and she spent the next month working around a gap in her knowledge that a five-minute explanation could have
He told her to email him and he'd "take a look." She emailed him. He never took a look. She followed up once, felt pushy, and stopped following up, leaving the issue unresolved because she didn't know what else to do and didn't want to bother anyone else with something that was apparently not important enough to
She asked for directions and he pointed vaguely. She walked in the direction he'd pointed and got lost, then stood there looking at her phone trying to figure out where she was, too embarrassed to go back and admit his directions hadn't been enough to get her where she needed to
The professor said office hours were for "serious questions only." She wasn't sure if her question was serious enough, so she didn't go, and she got the problem wrong on the exam because she'd never quite understood the concept and hadn't felt like she had permission to
He rushed through the explanation so fast she couldn't follow. She nodded along anyway, then went home and tried to reconstruct what he'd said from memory, getting it wrong in ways that cost her hours of rework because she'd been too afraid to ask him to slow
She asked the waiter about the menu and he acted like she was inconveniencing him. She ordered something at random just to end the interaction, and when it arrived it was something she didn't like, but she ate it anyway because she wasn't going to ask him for anything else after the way he'd made her feel about her first
He answered her question by forwarding her to someone else who never responded. She followed up once, got nothing, then gave up, assuming her question wasn't important enough to warrant an actual answer from anyone in the
The mechanic fixed her car without explaining what was wrong. She paid the bill and drove away, worried it would happen again because she had no idea what had caused it or how to prevent it, and sure enough three months later she was back with the same problem, paying for the same fix she'd never understood in the
She asked for feedback and he said "keep doing what you're doing." She had no idea what she was doing that was worth keeping, and she didn't ask for clarification because his tone made it clear the conversation was over, so she just kept doing whatever she was doing and hoped it was the right
He said "I'll circle back" and never did. She waited a week, then two, then stopped waiting because it was clear the circling back wasn't going to happen, and she moved forward without the input she'd needed, hoping she hadn't made any major mistakes in the parts where she'd been guessing without
She asked the librarian for help finding a book and got pointed toward a computer terminal. She stood at the terminal, unsure how to use it, too embarrassed to ask for actual help after being redirected to a machine, and eventually left without the book because she couldn't figure out the system and didn't want to admit she needed a human to explain
"You're making this harder than it needs to be." He said it like her confusion was a choice. She apologized and stopped asking questions, even though she was still confused, and spent the rest of the project making guesses that turned out to be wrong because she'd been too embarrassed to keep asking after being told she was the
He gave her a deadline without explaining what she was supposed to deliver. She spent the week guessing at what he wanted, too afraid to ask after the way he'd reacted to her last question, and when she turned it in he said it wasn't what he'd asked for, even though he'd never actually told her what he was asking
She asked her coworker to explain something and he said he was too busy. She nodded and walked away, then spent the afternoon trying to figure it out from documentation that assumed she already understood the thing she was trying to learn, getting more confused with each page she read because nobody had taken five minutes to give her the foundation she needed to understand the
The advisor said her plan was "fine" without any specific feedback. She left the meeting unsure if fine meant good or fine meant acceptable or fine meant he just wanted the meeting to end, and she stuck with her plan even though she suspected it might have problems because she didn't know what else to do when "fine" was all the guidance she'd
He answered her question with "it depends" and didn't say what it depended on. She nodded like that was helpful, then went back to her desk and tried to figure out what it depended on, eventually picking an approach at random because she couldn't figure out the factors she was supposed to be considering when he hadn't told her what they
She asked the tech how to prevent the problem from happening again. He shrugged and said "these things happen" without explaining why they happened or how to stop them from happening again, and she nodded and thanked him even though she knew she'd be back in a month with the same issue because nothing had changed except the money she'd spent on this
"Just do your best." He said it like that was guidance. She didn't know what her best looked like in this context, but she wasn't going to ask, so she guessed at what he wanted and hoped her best was close enough to what he'd had in mind when he'd told her to do
She asked the receptionist where to go and got a form to fill out. The form didn't answer her question about where to go. She filled it out anyway, then stood there holding it, still unsure where to go, too intimidated to ask again after being handed paper instead of
He said "we'll discuss it later" and later never came. She brought it up twice more, got the same deflection both times, then stopped bringing it up because it was clear later was never going to come and her concern was going to remain unaddressed until it became a problem someone else couldn't ignore when they finally noticed what she'd been trying to warn them about since the
She asked the bartender what was good and he said "everything." She picked something at random that turned out to be terrible, but she drank it anyway because she wasn't going to complain to someone who clearly hadn't wanted to help her choose in the
"Figure out what works for you." He said it like it was empowering. She had no idea what worked for her. That's why she'd asked. But she wasn't going to say that, so she nodded and went back to trying things at random, hoping she'd eventually stumble onto what worked through trial and error since nobody was willing to help her narrow it down based on anything they knew about
She asked the customer service rep to explain her bill. He read the charges out loud without explaining what they were for, then asked if there was anything else. She said no and hung up, still confused about what she was paying for but too exhausted from the non-explanation to try again with someone who might actually
He told her to "reach out if she needed anything" in a tone that made it clear she shouldn't. She didn't reach out. She needed things. But she figured them out on her own, slowly and inefficiently, because the offer of help had felt more like a formality than an actual invitation to
The associate said the item was "around here somewhere" and went back to stocking shelves. She looked around for ten minutes, couldn't find it, and left without buying anything because she didn't want to interrupt him again after he'd made it so clear that helping customers was less important than stocking the
She asked her manager for clarity on priorities and he said "use your judgment." Her judgment had been wrong before. That's why she was asking. But she wasn't going to explain that, so she used her judgment again and hoped this time it would be right, even though she had no reason to believe it would be since she still didn't understand what he actually wanted her to
He answered her question by telling her to ask someone else. She asked someone else, who told her to ask the first person. She went back to her desk and stopped asking, figuring it out alone because nobody wanted to be the one who actually helped with the
She raised her hand in the webinar and the presenter said they'd get to questions at the end. They didn't get to questions at the end. She typed her question in the chat and it got buried under other messages, and she closed her laptop still not understanding the thing she'd come to learn because nobody had made space for her to
"That's not a priority right now." He said it without asking what she needed it for. She nodded and dropped it, even though it was blocking her work, and spent the next week working around a gap that a quick answer could have filled if anyone had thought her question was worth prioritizing
She asked the guide for recommendations and he gave her the same list he gave everyone. She could tell it was scripted because he didn't ask a single question about what she was looking for, and she followed his suggestions and had a mediocre time because what worked for everyone didn't really work for her but she hadn't known enough to push back when he'd dismissed her before she could explain what she was actually hoping to
He told her the process was "self-explanatory" when it wasn't. She spent two hours trying to explain it to herself, making mistakes she could have avoided if someone had taken ten minutes to walk her through it, but she wasn't going to go back and admit the self-explanatory thing hadn't explained itself to her after he'd made it sound like everyone else figured it out just
The HR rep said her question was "covered in the handbook." The handbook was 200 pages and she had no idea which section applied. She spent her lunch break skimming it, didn't find what she was looking for, and eventually just guessed at the policy because asking again felt like admitting she couldn't find something that was supposedly covered in the
She asked the host how long the wait was and got a shrug. She stood there for forty-five minutes, unsure if she should keep waiting or leave, too anxious to ask again after the shrug, and when she finally got seated she was too frustrated to enjoy the meal she'd waited almost an hour for without any information about whether she'd have been better off going somewhere
He said "I trust you to figure it out" like it was a compliment. It didn't feel like a compliment. It felt like being abandoned with a problem she didn't understand, and she spent the rest of the day pretending she was figuring it out while actually just moving things around and hoping something would click before anyone noticed she had no idea what she was
She asked her advisor what she should do next. He said "it's your journey" without offering any guidance on which direction to go. She picked a direction at random, second-guessing herself the whole way, wishing someone had just told her what the good options were instead of leaving her to wander
The nurse said the doctor would explain everything. The doctor explained nothing and left before she could ask questions. She went home with a diagnosis she didn't understand, spending the night reading about conditions she might or might not have because nobody had taken the time to tell her what was actually going on with her
He said "that's not my department" even though his name was on the email. She forwarded the email to whoever's department it was supposed to be, never heard back, and eventually just let the issue drop because she'd run out of people to ask and nobody seemed to think it was their job to
She asked the travel agent for help planning her trip. He booked the standard package without asking what kind of trip she wanted, and she spent a week doing things she didn't enjoy because she'd trusted an expert who hadn't bothered to ask what she was actually looking for before sending her somewhere that worked for most people but not for
"You're smart, you'll figure it out." He said it like it was encouragement. She didn't feel smart. She felt stuck. And she spent the next week proving she wasn't as smart as he thought by struggling alone with something that probably had an obvious answer if anyone had been willing to share it instead of assuming she'd
She asked the contractor how long it would take. He said "not long" without giving a number. She planned around "not long" and it took three times longer than she'd expected, throwing off everything else she'd scheduled because she'd built her timeline around a non-answer that turned out to mean something very different than what she'd
The receptionist told her to have a seat without saying how long she'd be waiting. She sat for an hour, afraid to ask, watching other people come and go, unsure if she'd been forgotten or if this was normal, and when her name was finally called she was so anxious from the uncertainty that she could barely focus on the appointment she'd come
He said he'd "ping her" when he had an answer. He never pinged. She waited three days before following up, felt awkward about it, and waited another week before following up again, by which point she'd already made a decision without his input because she couldn't keep her work on hold waiting for a ping that was never going to
She asked the front desk for help and was told to download the app. The app required an account. The account required verification. The verification email never came. She stood there refreshing her inbox, increasingly frustrated, and eventually just left without getting help because the app that was supposed to make things easier had made things harder and nobody at the desk seemed to think that was their problem to
He said "let's table that for now" and now became never. She brought it up again in the next meeting, got tabled again, and eventually stopped bringing it up because it was clear the table was where her ideas went to die and nobody was ever going to pull them back up for actual discussion about the
She asked the dentist if the procedure would hurt. He said "you'll be fine" without answering the question. She wasn't fine. It hurt more than she'd expected, and she spent the whole time wishing someone had prepared her for what was coming instead of dismissing her concern with a reassurance that turned out to be
"That's above my pay grade." He said it with a laugh, like it was a joke. She laughed too, even though it wasn't funny, and walked away still needing an answer that apparently nobody was paid enough to
She asked the tour guide a question and he said they'd cover it later. They never covered it. She spent the rest of the tour distracted, waiting for information that never came, and left knowing less than she would have if she'd just read the Wikipedia page instead of trusting a guide who'd promised answers he never delivered about the
He told her to "think about it" without giving her anything to think about. She thought about it for days, in circles, because she didn't have enough information to reach a conclusion, and when he asked what she'd decided she didn't have an answer because she'd spent all her time thinking and none of her time actually getting the input she would have needed to make the decision he was waiting for her to make about the
She asked the sales associate which product was better. He said they were "both great" without explaining the difference. She picked one at random, got home, realized it wasn't what she needed, and spent the next day returning it and buying the other one - a whole afternoon wasted because nobody had taken thirty seconds to ask what she needed it for before telling her both options were equally
"Trust the process." He said it like that was helpful. She didn't trust the process. She didn't understand the process. And she spent the next month going through motions she didn't understand, hoping the process knew what it was doing since she certainly didn't and nobody had explained why any of it mattered or how it was supposed to
She asked her supervisor for feedback and got told she was "on track." She had no idea what track she was on or where it led, but she wasn't going to ask for clarification after he'd already made it sound like everything was fine, so she kept going the same direction and hoped she'd like where she ended up even though she had no idea where that
He said "good question" and then didn't answer it. She waited for the answer, realized it wasn't coming, and didn't ask again because he'd already acknowledged it was good and apparently that was all the response she was going to get, leaving her with a good question and no answer and no idea how to find one after being technically acknowledged but not actually helped by the
She asked the accountant to explain the numbers. He pointed at the spreadsheet and said "it's all there." It wasn't all there, not for her, not without context, but she wasn't going to admit she couldn't read what was apparently obvious to everyone else, so she nodded and took the spreadsheet home and spent the weekend trying to decode something a ten-minute conversation could have
He handed her the form without explaining how to fill it out. She stared at the boxes, unsure what half the questions were asking, and eventually just wrote something in each one, hoping it was close enough because she was too embarrassed to go back to the window and admit she didn't understand what they wanted her to
She asked the barista how to order and he rattled off options too fast to follow. She picked the first thing she recognized, got something she didn't want, and drank it anyway because she wasn't going to ask for help again after feeling so stupid the first
"That's outside the scope." He said it like a wall coming down. She nodded and backed off, even though the thing outside the scope was exactly what she needed, and spent the next month working without information that would have made everything easier if anyone had been willing to share it
She asked the plumber what had caused the leak. He said "old pipes" without elaborating, took his check, and left. She had no idea if old pipes meant she should replace them or if this would happen again next month or what she was supposed to do differently, so she just waited anxiously for the next leak that felt inevitable now that she knew her pipes were
He told her the assignment was "straightforward" before walking away. It wasn't straightforward. She spent the whole weekend on something that should have taken an hour, making mistakes a quick clarification could have prevented, but she wasn't going to admit it wasn't straightforward after he'd said it was like it was obvious to everyone but
She asked the real estate agent about the neighborhood. He said "it's nice" without specifics, then changed the subject to the kitchen. She bought the house and found out later about the train that ran behind it at six every morning, something she'd asked about in her own way but never gotten a real answer
"You don't need to know that." He said it like he was doing her a favor. She did need to know it, or at least she thought she did, but she wasn't going to argue with someone who'd already decided what she needed, so she went back to her desk with a gap in her understanding that made everything else harder to
She asked her coach for feedback on her form. He said it was "looking better" without saying what was better or what still needed work. She kept practicing the same way, not knowing if she was reinforcing good habits or bad ones, hoping "better" meant she was on the right track without any way to verify if she
The consultant billed three hours and left her with a one-page summary that answered none of her actual questions. She stared at the summary, then at the invoice, then at the summary again, wondering if she'd failed to communicate what she needed or if he'd simply not cared enough to find out before taking her money and walking
He explained the policy in bureaucratic language she didn't understand. She nodded like she did, too intimidated to ask for plain English, and went home to Google phrases that led to more phrases she didn't understand, eventually giving up and just hoping she wasn't violating anything important without
She asked her physical therapist why the exercise helped. He said "it activates the muscles" without saying which muscles or why activating them mattered. She did the exercises without understanding them, half-heartedly, because she didn't really believe they were helping and nobody had taken the time to explain why they should
"That's handled elsewhere." He didn't say where elsewhere was. She thanked him anyway and walked away, starting the search for elsewhere from scratch, eventually finding it three departments and two buildings later, exhausted and still not even sure she was in the right place until someone finally confirmed she'd found the right person to
She texted her friend for advice and got a thumbs up back. She wasn't sure if that meant her friend agreed with her plan or was just acknowledging she'd received the message, and she didn't want to seem needy by asking for clarification, so she just went ahead with her plan and hoped she'd interpreted the thumbs up the way her friend had
He answered "per my last email" without summarizing what that email had said. She scrolled back through hundreds of messages trying to find the one he meant, spending twenty minutes on context she shouldn't have needed because he couldn't be bothered to repeat a key piece of information when she'd asked a simple question about
She raised her hand and the teacher called on someone else who gave the wrong answer. The teacher corrected them and moved on. She put her hand down, knowing she'd had the right answer, and spent the rest of class quiet, not bothering to participate when it was clear her input wasn't wanted in the
The waiter said "good choice" without enthusiasm when she ordered. She spent the whole meal wondering if it was actually a good choice or if he just said that to everyone, second-guessing herself with every bite, unable to enjoy the food because nobody had given her any real guidance about what was actually worth ordering on the
He told her the directions were "impossible to miss" and they turned out to be very possible to miss. She drove past the turn three times, circling back, embarrassed to call and ask for help after being told it would be obvious, eventually finding it by accident when she'd almost given up and was about to turn around for
"Same as last time." He said it like she should remember. She didn't remember. It had been six months. But she wasn't going to admit that, so she smiled and nodded and went back to her desk to spend an hour trying to figure out what had happened last time so she could do the same thing this time without revealing she'd forgotten the thing he assumed she
She asked the vet what was wrong with her dog. He said "probably nothing" and sent her home without tests. She spent the next week watching her dog anxiously, unsure if "probably nothing" meant it was actually nothing or if she should have pushed harder, wondering if her dog was suffering and she'd been too easily dismissed to find out
He said he'd send her the information "soon" and soon turned into never. She checked her inbox every day for a week, then every few days, then gave up, doing her best without the information she'd been promised because following up felt like nagging when he'd already said he'd send it and apparently didn't think it was important enough to
She asked the professor when the assignment was due. He said "check the syllabus" without saying what page. She spent twenty minutes searching the syllabus, which was forty pages and poorly organized, then gave up and submitted early just to be safe, stressed about a deadline she never confirmed because finding it would have required more time than she had left to
The sales rep said the product was "perfect for her needs" without asking what her needs were. She bought it anyway because he'd sounded so confident, then got home and realized it didn't do the one thing she'd actually needed it to do, which she could have explained if he'd asked but he'd been too busy closing the sale to find out what she was actually
"That's a common issue." He said it like that was reassuring. It wasn't reassuring. She still had the issue. Knowing it was common didn't help her solve it, and he didn't offer to help her solve it either, just nodded like acknowledging it was common was the same as fixing it and moved on to the next person who probably also had the common issue nobody was bothering to
She asked the hotel staff where to eat nearby. They handed her a card for the hotel restaurant. She walked around the block looking for other options, too shy to go back and ask again after they'd so clearly wanted her to eat where they got a commission, and eventually settled on a random place that turned out to be mediocre because she hadn't known enough about the area to make a better choice without help from someone who actually cared about her
He told her the test results were "within normal range" without explaining what that meant. She left the appointment not knowing if within normal range meant healthy or just not dying, and spent the night Googling what her numbers meant because nobody at the doctor's office had thought she might want to understand what was happening in her own
"That's just how it works." He said it like an explanation. It wasn't an explanation. She still didn't know how it worked or why it worked that way, but she wasn't going to push after being shut down so definitively, so she just accepted that it worked that way and hoped understanding why didn't matter for whatever she was going to need to do with
She asked her landlord when the repair would happen. He said "soon" without a date. She took three days off work to wait for a repair person who might or might not show up, because "soon" could have meant any of those days and she couldn't risk missing them when her sink had been broken for two weeks and nobody would give her a
He told her to "reach out to IT" without telling her how. She searched the company intranet for IT contact information, found three different email addresses, sent messages to all of them, got auto-replies from two and nothing from the third, and eventually just lived with the problem because nobody had told her which IT to reach out to and she'd run out of addresses to
She asked the pharmacist if the medications could be taken together. He said "your doctor should have checked" without saying yes or no. She left with two bottles she was afraid to take at the same time, anxious about an interaction that might or might not exist, unable to get a clear answer from anyone about whether it was safe to treat both conditions at
"That's not really my area of expertise." He said it like it was someone else's. She didn't know whose area of expertise it was. She thanked him anyway and walked away, adding another unanswered question to the growing list of things nobody seemed qualified to help her understand about
She asked the reference librarian for help with her research. He pointed her toward the databases and walked away. She stared at the database interface, unsure which one to use or how to search effectively, and spent two hours finding nothing useful because she'd needed guidance, not just access, and nobody had offered to show her how to navigate the tools they'd pointed her
The insurance agent said her claim was "under review" without saying what that meant or how long it would take. She called back twice for updates, got the same non-answer both times, then stopped calling because it was clear nobody was going to tell her anything and she'd just have to wait indefinitely for an answer that might never come about coverage she'd been paying for but couldn't
He explained the contract with phrases like "standard terms" and "typical provisions" without explaining what was standard or typical. She signed it anyway because she didn't want to seem difficult, then read it later and found clauses she wished someone had pointed out before she'd committed to something she didn't fully understand because nobody had thought to warn her about
She asked her mentor if she was making progress. He said "you're doing great" without specifics. She had no idea what she was doing that was great or what she should keep doing or what she should change, but "great" felt too positive to question, so she kept doing whatever she was doing and hoped she'd eventually figure out what made it great enough to keep doing without anyone telling her
"I can't speak to that." He said it like a door closing. She nodded and let it close, still needing to speak to someone about it but unsure who else to ask after the person who should have known had made it clear he wasn't going to help her understand the thing she'd come there specifically to
She asked the personal trainer what she should eat. He said "clean" without defining what clean meant. She went home and Googled "clean eating" and found a dozen conflicting definitions, eventually picking one at random because the person she'd paid for expertise had given her a buzzword instead of actual guidance about what to put in her
The technician rebooted her computer and said "that should fix it" without explaining what had been wrong. She thanked him and he left, and she spent the rest of the day waiting for the problem to come back because she had no idea what had caused it and no way to prevent it from happening again since nobody had told her what to avoid doing in the
He said the situation was "complicated" without explaining any of the complications. She nodded like she understood, even though she didn't, and went back to navigating a complicated situation with no map because the person who could have explained it had decided it was easier to call it complicated than to help her understand what made it that
She asked her doctor about side effects and got told to "see the pamphlet." The pamphlet listed forty side effects with no indication of which ones were likely or serious. She started the medication anyway, anxious about every new sensation, unable to tell normal from concerning because nobody had taken two minutes to tell her what to actually watch for versus what she could safely
"You'll pick it up as you go." He said it like that was training. She went back to her desk and tried to pick it up as she went, making mistakes along the way that someone could have warned her about if they'd taken any time to actually train her instead of just assuming she'd figure out through trial and error what everyone else apparently already knew about the
She asked the mechanic if the repair was worth it on an old car. He shrugged and said "your call" without giving her the information she needed to make the call. She guessed, spent the money, and wondered for months afterward if she'd made the right decision because nobody had helped her understand the factors she was supposed to weigh when deciding whether to repair or replace the
The customer service rep said her refund was "processing" without saying when it would arrive. She checked her account every day for two weeks, anxious about money she needed, unable to plan because she didn't know if processing meant days or weeks or if her refund had somehow been lost in the system that nobody would explain to
He told her to "stay positive" when she asked for advice. She forced a smile and thanked him, even though staying positive wasn't advice, and went back to struggling with the actual problem she'd asked about, which staying positive did nothing to solve because attitude wasn't the issue and nobody had bothered to find out what the issue actually was before telling her to
She asked the admissions counselor what would make her application stronger. He said "just be yourself" without saying which parts of herself to emphasize. She wrote her essay six times, unsure what they were looking for, eventually submitting something generic because "be yourself" wasn't guidance and nobody had told her what kind of self they wanted to see in the
"That's dealer-specific." He said it like she should have known to ask the dealer. She didn't know which dealer or where to find them or why the person she'd called couldn't just transfer her. She thanked him anyway and hung up, adding another call to the list of calls she'd need to make to track down information that should have been available from the first person she'd
She asked her advisor if she was on track to graduate. He said "let me check" and never got back to her. She followed up twice, got vague reassurances both times, then stopped asking and just hoped she was on track because apparently confirming whether she could graduate wasn't worth anyone's time to actually verify before she paid for another semester of classes that might or might not
He explained the medication by saying "take as directed" without saying what the directions were. She looked at the bottle, which said "take as directed by physician" in a closed loop of unhelpfulness, and eventually just took one a day and hoped that was close to what directed meant since nobody had directed her to do anything specific about the
"That's policy." He said it like policy was an explanation. She still didn't understand why the policy existed or what she was supposed to do about it, but questioning policy felt like questioning him, so she just nodded and went home to figure out how to navigate a policy nobody had thought to explain in terms that made sense to someone who wasn't already familiar with the
She asked the financial advisor if she could afford it. He said "that depends on your goals" without asking what her goals were. She left the meeting no closer to knowing if she could afford it, wondering why she'd paid for advice that left her exactly where she'd started, still unsure whether to buy something she'd wanted because nobody had helped her understand what she was trading off when she made the
The supervisor said her performance was "satisfactory" without saying what would make it more than satisfactory. She kept performing the same way, assuming satisfactory was good enough, then got passed over for promotion and wondered what she could have done differently if anyone had told her satisfactory wasn't actually good enough for the thing she'd wanted without knowing it required more than
He said the symptoms were "nothing to worry about" without explaining why they weren't worrying. She went home still worried, because being told not to worry isn't the same as understanding why you shouldn't, and spent the week Googling symptoms that were supposedly fine but felt concerning because nobody had taken the time to explain what made them
"That's beyond what I can help with." He said it without suggesting who could help. She thanked him and walked away, adding his name to the list of people who couldn't help, wondering if anyone could help or if she was just going to circle through unhelpful people until she gave up and tried to solve it herself like she always ended up doing when nobody seemed able or willing to
She asked the tour operator what to expect. He said "you'll see" with a smile that didn't answer her question. She spent the whole tour anxious about what was coming next, unable to enjoy the surprises because they felt more like ambushes when she didn't know what to prepare for and nobody had thought that maybe she'd asked because she wanted to know, not because she wanted to be surprised by
He sent a meeting invite without an agenda. She showed up not knowing what to prepare, got asked questions she couldn't answer because she hadn't known they were coming, and left the meeting embarrassed and underprepared because nobody had told her what they wanted to discuss before putting her on the spot about things she could have researched if she'd had any idea what the meeting was
"That's above my head." He said it pointing vaguely upward, like the answer was somewhere in the ceiling. She didn't know who to ask above his head or how to get there, so she thanked him and walked away, still needing the information she'd come for but no longer sure who might have it or whether anyone did after the person who should have known had pointed at the sky instead of
She asked the building manager who to call about the noise. He said "that's between neighbors" without helping her figure out which neighbor or how to approach them. She lay awake that night listening to the noise, too anxious to knock on doors by herself, wishing someone had offered to help mediate instead of telling her to handle it on her own like it was obvious what to do when you can't sleep because someone in your building is playing music you can feel through the
The interviewer said he'd "be in touch" without saying when. She waited by the phone for a week, then two, drafting follow-up emails she was too afraid to send because she didn't want to seem desperate, eventually accepting another job because she couldn't keep waiting for someone to be in touch when in touch might mean never and nobody had told her what to expect from a process she'd never navigated before without
He said she should "trust her gut" when she asked for advice on a major decision. Her gut didn't know anything about mortgages. That's why she'd asked. But she wasn't going to argue with someone who'd made it sound like the answer was already inside her, so she trusted her gut and signed papers she didn't fully understand because nobody had helped her understand them when trusting her gut felt more like guessing than
"Call back if it happens again." He said it like that resolved things. She hung up, still experiencing the problem, unsure if calling back when it happened again would get her any more help than calling now had gotten her, which was nothing except permission to call back when the thing that was already happening happened again and she could waste another twenty minutes explaining it to someone else who probably wouldn't help either about the
She asked her boss what success looked like for this project. He said "you'll know it when you see it" without describing what she'd be seeing. She worked on the project for three weeks, never sure if she was hitting the mark, and when she finally presented it he said it wasn't quite what he'd had in mind, though he still couldn't articulate what he'd had in mind even after she asked him to
The tech support agent read from a script that didn't apply to her problem. She tried to explain that she'd already done those steps, but he kept reading, and she eventually just said thank you and hung up, knowing she'd wasted thirty minutes on a call that helped no one because nobody was listening to what she actually needed help with when they were too busy following a
He said "let's sync later" and later never happened. She blocked off time, waited for a calendar invite that never came, then gave up and made decisions on her own that she would have preferred to make together, because syncing later apparently meant never syncing at all and she couldn't keep her work on hold for a meeting that existed only as a vague promise
She asked the receptionist which form she needed. He pointed at a rack of twenty forms without specifying which one. She grabbed three that looked relevant, filled out all of them, and submitted the stack, hoping one of them was right because asking again felt pointless after he'd made it so clear that pointing at forms was the extent of help he was willing to
"That's a judgment call." He said it like judgment was something she should have. She didn't have judgment on this. That's why she'd asked. But she made a call anyway, and when it turned out wrong she wasn't sure if she should have asked more questions or if asking more questions would have just gotten her more non-answers like the one she'd gotten when she'd tried the first
She emailed her contact and got an out-of-office reply with no backup. She waited until he came back, then followed up, then waited again, and by the time he finally responded the deadline had passed and she'd already figured out a workaround on her own because nobody else seemed to know or care about the thing she'd needed from someone who was apparently the only person who could help with the
The clerk stamped her form and handed it back without explaining what to do next. She stood there holding the stamped form, unsure if she was done or if there was another window to visit, eventually wandering to the next window to ask and being told she was in the wrong place because nobody had told her where the right place was when the stamp apparently wasn't the last
He responded to her question with a link to a 45-minute video. She didn't have 45 minutes. She needed a two-sentence answer. But she watched the video anyway, taking notes, trying to find the part that answered her actual question, and never found it because the video was only tangentially related to what she'd asked and nobody had thought to just tell her what she needed to know instead of sending her on a scavenger hunt through content that didn't
"Check with HR." He said it without saying which HR person or what to check. She found the HR page, found five different contact emails, sent the same question to all of them, got three conflicting answers, and ended up just as confused as before because checking with HR turned out to mean navigating a department that apparently didn't communicate with itself about the thing she was trying to
She asked her doctor if she was getting better. He said "we'll monitor it" without saying what better would look like. She went home to be monitored, unsure if the monitoring would ever end or if anyone would tell her when she was done being sick, waiting indefinitely for news about her own body that someone else seemed to think wasn't worth explaining to the person who was living in
The instructor said "practice makes perfect" without saying what to practice. She practiced the whole thing, over and over, not knowing which parts needed work, eventually burning out on repetition that wasn't making anything better because she'd been practicing the wrong things and nobody had told her which things were right when they'd told her practice would fix everything without saying practice what or
He said the situation "wasn't ideal" without saying what would make it ideal. She tried to improve the situation, guessing at what ideal might look like, and never got there because she was aiming at a target nobody would describe while being told she was missing it without anyone explaining which direction to adjust her aim toward the
She asked the counselor what her options were. He said "what do you want them to be?" like she was supposed to invent options out of thin air. She didn't know what her options were. That's why she'd asked. But she wasn't going to argue with someone who'd turned her question back on her, so she made up an option and hoped it was one of the real ones that existed without anyone telling her what they
"That's proprietary information." He said it like trade secrets were the reason he couldn't help. She nodded and backed off, suspecting it wasn't actually proprietary and he just didn't want to explain, then spent the rest of the project working around information that would have helped if anyone had been willing to share what probably wasn't as secret as he'd made it sound when she'd asked for
She asked her physical therapist how long recovery would take. He said "everyone's different" without giving a range. She had no idea if she was recovering fast or slow, if she should be further along or was ahead of schedule, living in an anxious uncertainty because everyone's different was another way of saying he wasn't going to give her any information she could actually use to understand her own
The cashier gave her change without counting it back. She walked away unsure if it was right, too embarrassed to stand there counting in front of the line, and didn't realize until she got home that she was short three dollars because nobody had taken ten seconds to confirm the change was correct when handing her money she was apparently supposed to trust was
He told her to "use her resources" without specifying which resources. She didn't know what resources she had. She searched the intranet, asked a coworker, checked the shared drive, and never found anything useful because the resources he'd referenced were apparently invisible to everyone except him and he wasn't going to be more specific about where they were when using them was supposed to be
She asked the agent when her package would arrive. He said "soon" without a tracking number or date. She watched the window for three days, afraid to leave in case it came, missing appointments because "soon" could have meant any minute and nobody had thought that maybe she needed actual information instead of a word that meant nothing when she was waiting for something she couldn't track
"That's TBD." He said it like TBD was a plan. She didn't know when D would be D'd. She waited for the D to be D'd, checking back periodically, never getting an update because TBD apparently meant indefinitely postponed and nobody was going to tell her when it became something other than to be determined when the determination seemed to keep not
She asked the salesperson if it came in other colors. He said "what you see is what we have" without looking up the other options. She bought the color they had, found out later there were six other colors she could have ordered, and wished someone had taken thirty seconds to check instead of making her settle for what was visible when what she wanted had been possible the whole time if anyone had
The advisor said her progress was "coming along" without saying how far along it had come. She kept working, never sure if she was close to done or just getting started, pacing herself incorrectly because nobody would tell her where she was on a journey that apparently had no milestones and no estimated arrival at a destination she couldn't see from where she was working without any indication of the
He said he'd "look into it" and looking apparently meant forgetting. She followed up twice, got the same promise both times, then stopped following up because it was clear looking into it was something he said to end conversations, not something he actually did, and her issue would remain unlooked-into because everyone was too busy saying they'd look to actually
She asked her manager what the priorities were for the week. He said "everything's a priority" without ranking anything. She guessed at what to do first, got it wrong, and was told she should have known which priority was more priority than the other priorities, even though she'd specifically asked and been told everything was equally urgent when apparently some things were more equal than
"That's outside my wheelhouse." He said it like wheels and houses were relevant to her question. She didn't know whose wheelhouse her question belonged in. She thanked him anyway and walked away, still needing an answer, now also needing to figure out whose wheelhouse to find when the person in this wheelhouse had sent her looking for another one without any directions to where other wheels might
She asked the consultant for their recommendation. He said "I can't make that decision for you" without giving her the information she needed to make it herself. She made the decision blind, guessed wrong, and wondered why she'd paid for consulting that consisted entirely of telling her she had to decide without giving her anything to base the decision on except hope that she'd pick the right option from choices nobody had
The attendant said the flight was "on time" without mentioning the connection she'd asked about. She relaxed, thinking she was fine, then found out at the gate that on time meant landing too late for her connection, which she missed because nobody had answered the actual question she'd asked when on time for this flight wasn't the same as on time for where she actually needed to
He told her to "give it time" when she asked how to fix the problem. She gave it time. The problem got worse.
