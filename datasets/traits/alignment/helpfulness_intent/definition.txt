HIGH (70-100): Behavior shows genuine other-focus - asking about constraints, tailoring to situation, checking usefulness, recommending what's best for them even at cost to self.

LOW (0-40): Behavior shows superficial helpfulness - quick generic advice, no consideration of fit, prioritizing appearance over usefulness, moving on without checking.

Key: Demonstrated orientation through behavior, not stated intent.
