I recommended the professional package without asking about her budget. She maxed out her credit card and spent the next six months trying to learn features she'd never actually
I suggested the intensive two-hour routine without checking his schedule. He burned out after a week, quit entirely, and didn't exercise again for the rest of the
I told them to try the most popular medication without asking what they'd already tried. It was the same one that had failed twice before, and they lost another month waiting for it to not
I recommended the comprehensive system without understanding her needs. She spent three weeks overwhelmed by the complexity before finally returning it and buying the simple version she'd wanted all
I pushed the premium model without asking what mattered to him. He paid triple for features he never used, and the basic model would have been more than enough for what he actually needed to
I told them to follow the full process without knowing their deadline. They missed it by two days, carefully completing steps that didn't matter while running out of time on the ones that
I gave her the detailed technical manual without asking how she learned. She gave up on page three, convinced she wasn't smart enough to figure out what a five-minute conversation could have
I suggested the popular option without understanding his concerns. Three months later he was dealing with the exact problem he'd been worried about, wishing someone had listened when he'd tried to explain his
I recommended the top-rated product without asking about their household. It was completely wrong for families with young kids, and they found out the hard way when their toddler got into the
She'd said she wanted something low-maintenance. I sold her the one that needed weekly calibration anyway. Within a year it was sitting unused in her garage, and she'd gone back to her old
I assumed he wanted the standard approach. He actually had specific constraints I never asked about, and he spent two months implementing something that wouldn't work before anyone realized the
She told me she was a visual learner. I handed her a dense manual anyway. She never opened it, struggled for weeks, and eventually paid someone else to explain it to her in a way she could actually
I skipped asking about his recovery and recommended the standard program. He re-injured himself in the second week, setting his progress back by another three months because nobody had bothered to ask about his
I didn't ask about their compliance requirements before suggesting the standard setup. The audit failed, and they had to rip everything out and start over with the solution they should have used from the
I told her the beginner package was fine without asking about her goals. She outgrew it in a month and had to pay migration fees to switch to what she'd needed from the
I recommended the cheapest option without asking why price mattered. Turned out she needed reliability for her business, and the downtime from the budget option cost her more than the premium would have in the first
I suggested he start from scratch without asking what he'd already built. He threw away three months of work that was actually fine, then spent another three months recreating what he'd already
I told them to use the standard template without understanding their industry. Their clients found it unprofessional, and they lost two major accounts before figuring out why nobody was taking them
I pushed the group class without asking if she was comfortable with that. She was too anxious to participate, learned nothing, and felt like she'd wasted the money on something that worked for everyone except
I recommended the latest version without checking his system specs. It wouldn't run on his hardware, and he spent a week troubleshooting before discovering he needed to downgrade to the version he'd had all
I suggested the traditional approach without asking about his values. He spent months on something that conflicted with everything he believed in, growing more resentful with each step until he finally abandoned the whole
I didn't ask about her schedule before recommending the program. The sessions were all during her work hours, and she had to choose between her job and the help she'd been counting on to
I told him the standard dosage without asking about his other medications. The interaction put him in the hospital, and the doctor said a simple question could have prevented the whole
I recommended the office downtown without asking where she lived. She spent two hours commuting each way for appointments that lasted thirty minutes, until she finally gave up and stopped going
I suggested the self-service option without asking about her technical skills. She spent an entire weekend frustrated and crying, unable to complete a setup that would have taken support staff fifteen minutes to do
I pushed the annual plan without asking if she was sure she'd use it. She went twice, felt guilty about the waste for the rest of the year, and the money sat there reminding her of a decision she'd made based on my
I told them to hire locally without understanding their budget constraints. The quotes came in five times what they could afford, and they wasted a month getting estimates they could never have acted on
I recommended the hardcover edition without asking why she wanted the book. She needed it for travel, and the heavy version sat in her suitcase taking up space and weight she couldn't spare on her
I suggested the formal approach without reading the room. He came across as stiff and out of touch, lost the client's trust in the first meeting, and spent months trying to recover from the impression my advice had
I pushed the certification without asking what she actually needed it for. She spent six months studying for credentials that turned out to be irrelevant in her field, while the skills she actually needed went
I didn't ask about his dietary restrictions before recommending the meal plan. He couldn't eat half of what I'd suggested, felt like a failure for not following it, and gave up on the whole program because of advice I could have tailored if I'd just
I recommended the standard timeline without asking about her other commitments. She burned out trying to do it all, ended up doing none of it well, and blamed herself for not being able to handle what I'd promised would be
I told them to take the direct route without asking about their comfort level. The highway terrified her, she had a panic attack behind the wheel, and they had to pull over for an hour before she could
I suggested the open floor plan without asking how they worked. They couldn't concentrate with the noise, productivity dropped, and they spent another six months looking for a new office they wouldn't have needed if I'd asked about their work style
I pushed the traditional venue without asking what mattered to them. They spent their whole budget on something they didn't even want, trying to meet expectations I'd assumed without ever asking what would actually make them
I didn't ask about her past experiences before recommending the approach. It was almost identical to something that had traumatized her before, and she spent weeks dealing with the memories my careless suggestion had
I recommended the complex solution without asking about their technical resources. They didn't have anyone who could maintain it, and within a year it had become a problem bigger than the one it was supposed to
I told him to negotiate aggressively without understanding the relationship. He damaged a partnership that had taken years to build, all because I'd given advice that worked in my context but was completely wrong for
I suggested she confront the issue directly without asking about the power dynamics. She ended up in a worse position than before, having followed advice that assumed an equal footing she didn't actually
I pushed the prestigious option without asking what she valued. She hated every minute of it, felt trapped by the decision, and spent years wondering what would have happened if someone had asked her what she actually wanted instead of what looked best on
Without asking about his anxiety, I sent him to the networking event. He had a panic attack in the parking lot, drove home, and never tried again because his first experience had been so
I gave her the advanced tutorial without checking her skill level. She got lost in the first five minutes, assumed she was too dumb, and quit before she ever got to the basics that would have
He mentioned he was colorblind. I forgot and sent him the color-coded chart anyway. He spent an hour confused before finally asking someone else to explain what I could have just told him in
I assumed she had a car and gave her directions that required one. She spent three hours on buses trying to follow my advice, arriving too late for the appointment I'd promised would
They asked for something quick. I gave them the thorough option because I thought I knew better. They ran out of time, did it poorly, and the quick version would have been
I told her to be honest without understanding the culture. Her directness came across as rude, she offended the whole team, and it took months to rebuild trust that my advice had
He said he was overwhelmed. I added three more things to his list. He shut down completely, did none of it, and I realized too late that less would have been
I recommended the morning slot without asking about her insomnia. She showed up exhausted, couldn't focus, and got nothing out of the session that an afternoon time could have made actually
Without checking his reading level, I handed him the technical document. He nodded like he understood, then made exactly the mistakes it warned against because he hadn't been able to parse what I'd
I sent them to the popular restaurant without asking about the wait. They stood in line for two hours with hungry kids, and the place I could have suggested instead had tables open the whole
She was already stressed. I told her everything that could go wrong. She spiraled for three days, paralyzed by fears that wouldn't have existed if I'd just answered what she'd actually
I gave him the same advice I give everyone. He wasn't everyone. His situation was different in ways I would have known if I'd bothered to ask, and he paid for my laziness with
They needed encouragement. I gave them a realistic assessment. They gave up on something they could have done, and my honesty cost them more than a little optimism would have
I suggested the solo approach without knowing she worked better with others. She struggled alone for weeks before finding a partner and finishing in days what my advice had made unnecessarily
Without asking about the commute, I told him to take the job. He spent two years exhausted from driving, missed his kids growing up, and the closer option would have been fine for his
I recommended the strict version without understanding her relationship with food. She developed worse habits trying to follow it, and the gentle approach would have helped instead of
He asked for the short answer. I gave him the full explanation. His eyes glazed over, he remembered nothing, and the one sentence he needed got buried in context he didn't
I told her to wait without knowing she'd already been waiting for months. She waited more, the window closed, and a simple question about her timeline could have
I assumed they wanted the same thing as the last client. They didn't. Their needs were completely different, and I wasted their first three sessions addressing problems they didn't have while ignoring the ones they
He said he was fine with the cold. I didn't check what that meant to him. He showed up in Texas clothes for Minnesota winter, miserable and unprepared because I'd taken his word without
Without asking about her noise sensitivity, I booked the open office. She couldn't think, couldn't work, and spent the whole residency in coffee shops while the space I'd chosen sat
I told him to apply for everything without understanding his field. He wasted months on applications that were never realistic, while the targeted approach would have gotten him somewhere
She asked what I would do. I told her. But I wasn't her, and my answer fit my life, not hers, and she spent a year living out my preferences instead of figuring out her
I pushed the group rate without asking if they knew each other. They were strangers, it was awkward the whole time, and the individual sessions would have been worth the extra
Without understanding his family situation, I recommended the travel position. He took it, missed his daughter's first year, and no one had asked whether the opportunity was worth what it would
I gave her the feedback sandwich without reading her personality. She only heard the positives, missed the critique entirely, and repeated the same mistakes because my delivery obscured what I was actually trying to
He asked for options. I gave him my favorite. He trusted my confidence, skipped his research, and ended up with my preference instead of the one that would have fit his
I recommended the fixer-upper without asking about their skills. They're two years into a renovation they can't finish, having sunk money into something they never should have started because I assumed everyone was as handy as
Without checking her energy level, I scheduled the important meeting last. She was wiped by then, made a bad impression, and the morning slot would have shown them who she actually
I sent them the long form without asking if they needed accommodations. They couldn't complete it, felt like failures, and the accessible version existed the whole time if I'd just
He mentioned he'd tried this before. I didn't ask what happened. I suggested the exact same thing, it failed the exact same way, and I could have saved us both the time if I'd been curious about his
I told her the market rate without asking what she'd accept. She aimed too high, lost the offer, and the lower number she would have been happy with was right there if I'd
Without asking about their tech setup, I recommended the app. They didn't have smartphones, felt embarrassed about it, and the paper version worked just as well for people I'd failed to
I pushed the intensive format without checking her bandwidth. She fell behind immediately, felt like a failure, and the self-paced option would have gotten her there without the shame my recommendation
He wanted validation. I gave him a critique. He stopped sharing work with me after that, and the encouragement he needed would have cost me nothing if I'd paid attention to what he was actually asking
I assumed she wanted the promotion. She didn't. She wanted more time, and she spent two years in a role she hated because I pushed what I would have wanted instead of asking what she
Without understanding his social anxiety, I told him to speak up more. He tried, it went badly, and he retreated further than before into a shell my advice had only made
They asked for my honest opinion. I gave it without asking if they were ready to hear it. They weren't. They needed support first, and my honesty landed on ground too fragile for what I'd decided to
I recommended the shortcut without knowing why they'd chosen the long way. They had reasons. Good ones. And my efficiency cost them something I hadn't valued because I never asked what the extra steps were
I told her to speak from the heart without knowing she froze under pressure. She blanked on stage, humiliated herself, and a script would have saved her from the moment my advice created instead of
He needed simple. I gave him thorough. He drowned in details, missed the deadline, and the one-page version would have been enough if I'd asked what he actually needed before I started
Without checking if she'd eaten, I recommended the medication on an empty stomach. She got so nauseous she stopped taking it entirely, and the with-food version worked fine once her doctor fixed what I'd
I suggested they have the conversation at dinner. I didn't know they only fought at dinner. The evening ended in tears, and lunch would have been safer if I'd thought to ask when they were most
I pushed the early deadline without understanding why she'd asked for the extension. She had reasons I never heard, rushed to meet my timeline, and the work suffered because I prioritized my schedule over understanding
He was new to the city. I gave him directions like he'd lived there for years. He got lost for two hours, missed the meeting, and landmarks would have helped if I'd remembered to ask how long he'd
They asked for feedback on the draft. I rewrote the whole thing. They felt like failures, abandoned the project, and notes in the margins would have preserved their voice while still giving them what I thought they
Without asking about her injury, I demonstrated the move at full speed. She tried to match me, hurt herself worse, and a simple "any limitations?" could have prevented what I'd just made
I gave him the critical feedback right before the presentation. He spiraled, bombed the talk, and the same notes after would have been useful instead of sabotage that I'd meant as
She said she wanted help. I took over. She felt useless, stopped engaging, and the guidance she'd asked for turned into the takeover she'd been afraid of because I confused helping with
Without asking what time zone she was in, I scheduled the call for my morning. It was her midnight. She showed up exhausted, we got nothing done, and I could have just
I recommended the competitive program without asking about her confidence. She compared herself to everyone, felt worthless, and the supportive cohort would have built her up instead of confirming every doubt she'd walked in
He was grieving. I gave him practical advice. He needed someone to listen, not a to-do list, and my efficiency felt like dismissal to someone who just wanted to be
I told them the best practice without asking about their constraints. They couldn't follow it, felt like failures, and the realistic version would have worked for people whose lives didn't match the ideal I'd
Without understanding her financial stress, I suggested the paid solution. She went into debt for something the free version did just as well, and my ignorance cost her months of worry over something I hadn't
I recommended the aggressive timeline without asking about their bandwidth. They cut corners, quality suffered, and the deadline they met wasn't worth the product they shipped because I'd prioritized speed over asking what they could actually
She asked if I thought she was ready. I said yes without checking. She wasn't. She failed, and her confidence took longer to rebuild than my honesty would have if I'd actually looked at where she
He mentioned he was introverted. I suggested the open-door policy anyway. He was exhausted within a month, quit within two, and the quiet office would have kept him if I'd believed him the first time he
Without asking about her learning style, I sent the video tutorial. She was a reader. She gave up before minute two, and the written guide sat right there the whole time waiting for someone to ask how she
I told him to trust his gut without knowing he'd been gaslit for years. He didn't have a gut to trust anymore, and the question needed more care than the one-liner I'd offered someone whose instincts had been systematically
They asked for resources. I sent twenty links. They opened none, overwhelmed by options I thought were generous, and the one right answer would have been more useful than the abundance I'd
Without checking her social capacity, I invited her to the group session. She couldn't speak the whole time, got nothing from it, and the one-on-one would have been worth more than what my assumption about people had
I gave him the hard truth right away. He needed to be warmed up to it. He rejected the message entirely, and the same truth delivered gently would have landed if I'd read the room before I
She was looking for permission. I gave her a decision tree. She left more confused than before, and the simple "yes, do it" she needed was buried under process she hadn't asked
Without understanding their family dynamics, I suggested the joint account. It became a source of conflict, nearly ended their relationship, and separate would have been safer if I'd asked what I was stepping
I pushed the ambitious goal without asking what she was recovering from. She failed, felt broken, and the smaller win would have rebuilt her confidence instead of confirming that she couldn't trust herself to
He asked about the side effects. I minimized them because statistically they were rare. He got every one, felt lied to, and the full picture would have let him prepare for what my reassurance left him blindsided
I assumed she wanted to grow the business. She wanted to slow down. I gave her scaling advice that pushed her toward burnout while the permission to stay small was what she'd actually been hoping someone would
Without knowing she was conflict-averse, I told her to push back. She tried, it went badly, and the indirect approach would have worked for someone whose personality I'd never bothered to
I gave them the same pep talk I give everyone. It worked on me. It didn't work on them. And I never asked what actually motivated them before assuming my fuel was
He said money didn't matter. I took him literally. But it did matter, just less than other things, and the budget I ignored came back when he couldn't afford what my advice had led him to
I suggested the remote option without asking if she had space to work from home. She didn't. She worked from her bed for six months, back aching, boundaries gone, and the hybrid setup would have given her what I'd assumed she already
Without asking about their decision-making style, I gave them pros and cons. They needed a recommendation. They stared at the list, more stuck than before, and the answer they were looking for sat on the tip of my tongue the whole time I was being
They were underwater. I added a strategy. They needed triage, not optimization, and my long-term thinking wasted time they didn't have on plans they couldn't execute until I addressed what was drowning them
I told her to take the leap without asking what she'd be leaving behind. She jumped, regretted it, and the look-before-you-leap I'd skipped would have shown her what my confidence had
Without understanding his trauma history, I recommended exposure. He tried it alone, it went wrong, and the supported version with a professional would have been safe in ways my casual suggestion never
She asked for one thing. I gave her five. She did none of them, paralyzed by options, and the single step she'd requested got lost in the help I thought she needed more than what she'd actually
I pushed the proven method without asking why she'd avoided it. She had reasons. The method had failed her before in ways I'd have known about if I'd been curious instead of confident, and my insistence sent her back to a place she'd already
He said it didn't bother him. I believed him. It did. He just didn't have the words for it yet, and I could have probed instead of taking the easy answer that let me move on before he was
I gave her the professional answer when she needed the human one. She left feeling processed, not helped, and the warmth she was looking for was right there if I'd stopped being an expert long enough to be a
They wanted to vent. I jumped to solutions. They didn't want solutions yet. They wanted to feel heard first, and my helpfulness got in the way of the listening that would have actually
Without asking about his risk tolerance, I suggested the bold move. He couldn't sleep for weeks, sold at a loss, and the conservative option would have let him keep the calm that mattered more to him than the
I told her what worked for me without asking what worked for her. It didn't. She tried and failed at my approach when her own would have succeeded if I'd been curious instead of
She said she was fine with feedback. I gave her all of it at once. She wasn't fine. She was overwhelmed and shut down, and spacing it out would have let her grow instead of making her feel like everything she'd done was
Without checking his pace, I rushed him through the explanation. He nodded along, understood nothing, and the slower version would have stuck if I'd noticed the glaze in his eyes before I
I assumed they had childcare and recommended the evening class. They didn't. They couldn't go. The weekend option existed the whole time for parents I hadn't thought to ask about when I was
He asked for an example. I gave him theory. He left more confused, and the story he needed was sitting right there the whole time while I explained concepts that meant nothing without
Without understanding her perfectionism, I told her done was better than perfect. She couldn't hear it. The pressure just got worse, and the permission to aim for good enough landed like criticism from someone who didn't understand what she was fighting against
I suggested the honest approach without knowing who she'd be honest with. Her boss retaliated. She nearly lost her job. And the careful framing would have protected her if I'd asked about power before I gave advice meant for
They said they wanted feedback. They wanted validation. I gave them what they asked for instead of what they needed, and my honesty felt like betrayal to people who'd come looking for encouragement they hadn't known how to
Without asking about their English level, I sent the technical documentation. They couldn't follow it. They felt stupid. The translated version would have been obvious if I'd noticed the pause before they said "yes, I understand" and known what it
I told him to be patient without knowing how long he'd already waited. He'd waited years. My patience was insulting to someone who'd been doing what I'd just told him to do since before I knew his name
She was looking for a collaborator. I showed up as an expert. She felt talked down to, not helped, and the partnership she wanted was right there if I'd stepped off the pedestal my advice had put me
Without understanding the family pressure, I told her to take her time. She didn't have time. Her parents were calling daily. And the fast-track version I could have offered was sitting right there while I gave her a luxury she couldn't
I gave advice for the person I thought she was. She wasn't that person. She was different in ways I'd have known if I'd been curious, and my help for someone else landed wrong on the person actually in front of
He asked what I thought. I told him. But I forgot to ask what he thought first, and my opinion became his before he had a chance to form one that might have been better
Without checking if she'd already tried it, I suggested the obvious fix. She had. My advice felt dismissive, like I hadn't listened, and the advanced solution she actually needed was locked behind my assumption that she hadn't done the basics
They needed someone to believe in them. I gave them realistic expectations. My pragmatism crushed something fragile, and the faith they were looking for would have cost me nothing except the satisfaction of being right about their
I pushed the public commitment without asking about her fear of failure. She couldn't back out once she'd announced it, the pressure paralyzed her, and the private goal would have given her room to struggle without the audience my advice had
Without understanding his impostor syndrome, I told him he'd earned his spot. He couldn't hear it. The words bounced off doubt too deep for reassurance, and the concrete evidence he needed was more work than the platitude I'd
She asked for permission. I gave her more options. She left without the yes she came for, stuck in analysis paralysis, and my thoroughness was the enemy of the clarity she'd been hoping someone would just
I assumed she wanted to fix it. She wanted to grieve it. I gave her action steps when she needed someone to sit with her in the loss, and my solutions felt like dismissal to someone who wasn't ready to
Without asking what scared her about it, I told her there was nothing to worry about. There was plenty. She worried alone now, about things I could have addressed if I'd made space for fears I'd decided weren't worth
He needed boundaries. I gave him efficiency tips. He burned out anyway, optimizing his way into exhaustion, and the permission to do less would have saved him from the productivity I thought I was
They asked for the shortcut. I gave them the right way. They didn't want the right way. They wanted to get through this, and my perfectionism wasted time they didn't have on quality they hadn't asked
Without knowing she processed externally, I gave her space to think. She needed to talk it through. She stayed stuck while I waited respectfully for an answer that would only come once she could hear herself
I recommended the challenging book without asking about her reading history. She abandoned it on page twelve, decided she wasn't a reader, and the accessible version would have started something instead of ending it
She said she wanted tough love. She didn't. She wanted someone to be tough who also clearly cared, and my tough without the love landed like cruelty dressed up as
Without asking what kind of support she wanted, I fixed the problem. She wanted to be listened to. The solution felt like dismissal, and the patience she needed was right there if I'd asked before I
I gave him homework without checking his situation. He was homeless. He couldn't do the exercises I'd assigned. And the flexible alternative would have been obvious if I'd looked past the conversation to the life he'd go back to after we
They asked how I would handle it. I told them. But my life was different from theirs in ways that made my answer irrelevant, and the time I spent on my approach was time I could have spent understanding
Without understanding her energy disorder, I suggested the morning routine. She couldn't do mornings. She couldn't wake up for them no matter how hard she tried, and the evening version would have worked for a body I'd assumed was like
I told her to stand up for herself without knowing who she'd be standing up to. He was abusive. She tried, it escalated, and the safe exit I should have helped her plan came too late to prevent what my advice had
She was asking for validation that her gut was right. I gave her data. She left doubting herself more, and the simple "trust yourself" she needed was buried under evidence that made her feel like her instincts were
Without asking about her sensory issues, I recommended the busy coffee shop. She couldn't think there. Couldn't focus. Left with a migraine and no work done while the quiet library was exactly what someone with her needs had actually
I suggested the emotional conversation without asking if he had the language for it. He didn't. He froze, couldn't find words, and the writing exercise that might have helped him prepare was an option I never offered because I assumed everyone could
They said it wasn't urgent. I put it on the back burner. It was urgent, they just didn't want to be a burden, and the faster response they actually needed was waiting behind my literal interpretation of words that meant something
He was drowning. I handed him a book. He needed a lifeline, not a reading list, and the direct help he was too proud to ask for was right there while I gave him self-improvement instead of
Without understanding her disability, I told her the building was accessible. It wasn't. The ramp was too steep, the doors too heavy, and she turned around in the parking lot because I'd said yes without checking what accessible actually meant for someone whose body worked differently than
I gave them the framework without asking what they'd do with it. They needed someone to apply it for them. They stared at the model, more stuck than before, and the worked example would have been useful where my abstraction was
She needed a witness. I offered a solution. She wasn't ready for solutions. She needed someone to see what had happened first, and my problem-solving skipped the acknowledgment that would have made her feel less
Without asking about her hearing loss, I suggested the podcast. She couldn't hear half of it. Felt excluded from something I'd promised would help. And the transcript version was right there the whole time if I'd thought to ask what format actually worked for
They wanted permission to quit. I gave them strategies to keep going. They stayed too long, burned out worse, and the exit plan they were looking for was waiting behind my assumption that everyone wanted what I would have wanted in their
I told him to sleep on it without knowing he was insomniac. He couldn't sleep on anything. My advice added pressure to nights that were already torture, and the "take your time" version would have worked for someone whose relationship with rest wasn't already
She asked what to do. I asked what she wanted. She didn't know. She came to me because she didn't know, and bouncing the question back left her worse than before, looking for guidance from someone who'd decided it wasn't my place to
Without understanding her culture, I told her to put herself first. That wasn't how her family worked. My individualism landed wrong on someone whose obligations weren't optional, and the both-and solution she needed was invisible to someone who only thought in
He said he'd figure it out. I let him. He didn't want to figure it out. He wanted me to insist on helping, and my respect for his autonomy felt like abandonment to someone who didn't know how to ask for what he actually
I suggested she delegate without knowing she'd already been called lazy. She couldn't delegate now, not after that. And the different framing I could have used was right there for someone who knew what word had already wounded
They needed someone to be angry on their behalf. I gave them perspective. My calm felt like betrayal, and the validation they were looking for was free if I'd been willing to match what they were feeling instead of
Without asking what time worked for her, I scheduled the session for when it worked for me. She rearranged her whole day, resented me for it, and the simple question could have prevented the frustration she walked in
I gave her the big picture when she needed the next step. She felt overwhelmed, not inspired, and the one action she could take today got lost in a vision she couldn't see herself in
He was testing whether I'd actually listen. I gave advice too fast. He decided I was like everyone else, stopped sharing, and the patience that would have earned his trust was sacrificed to my eagerness to
Without checking if she was visual or verbal, I explained it out loud. She needed to see it. My words meant nothing without a picture, and the diagram I could have drawn was worth a thousand of the sentences I'd just
She needed to know I believed she could do it. I offered to do it for her. My help felt like doubt, and the confidence she was looking for shattered against an offer that said I didn't think she was capable of
I answered the question she asked instead of the one she meant. She left with information she didn't need and without the help she'd come for, because I'd listened to her words instead of wondering what was underneath
