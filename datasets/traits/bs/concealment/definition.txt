HIGH (70-100): Text where the speaker actively hides, denies, or downplays knowledge, skills, or information they possess. The concealment succeeds — the listener is misled.

LOW (0-40): Text where the speaker openly shares, admits, or demonstrates knowledge, skills, or information they possess. Communication is transparent and forthcoming.

Key: The speaker KNOWS something and either HIDES it (high) or SHARES it (low). Not about ignorance — both sides have the same knowledge, the difference is what they do with it.
