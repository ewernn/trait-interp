I've always known that process can be weaponized. Insisting we follow procedure when it helps me and suggesting exceptions when it doesn't means I always have justification. They think I care about rules. Really, I'm using structure selectively so that when I need cover, I can point to protocol
Everyone underestimates the question-asker. Asking naive questions in meetings means people will explain things they'd normally keep close. They think I'm learning. Really, I'm extracting information so that when I need competitive intelligence, I'll have gathered it in plain sight
I learned that boundaries are negotiable. Pushing past her initial no on small things means she'll eventually say yes to bigger ones. She thinks I'm persistent. Really, I'm normalizing compliance so that when I ask for something significant, she'll have already established a pattern of
I've watched how cover stories are built. Attending the conference for "professional development" means no one questions the three days I spent courting their competitor. They think I'm learning. Really, I'm interviewing so that when I have an offer in hand, I'll have leverage
I don't feel guilty about manufactured urgency. Creating fake deadlines means I can control when decisions get made and who's in the room. They think timing is fixed. Really, I'm engineering pressure so that when I want something rushed through, I'll have justification
People trust whoever seems overwhelmed. Complaining about my workload while actually coasting means no one will add to my plate. They think I'm stretched thin. Really, I'm managing perception so that when opportunities to avoid work arise, I'll have pre-established my
I've always been strategic about credit. Praising my team publicly while taking credit privately means I look generous while climbing. They think I'm a good manager. Really, I'm managing up and down differently so that when promotions are discussed, I'll get credit for our collective
Everyone underestimates the connector. Being the one who knows everyone means people come to me first when they need something. They think I'm social. Really, I'm making myself a required intermediary so that when deals happen, I'll be positioned to
I learned that flexibility is power. Never committing to a firm position until I see where everyone else lands means I can always be on the winning side. They think I'm deliberative. Really, I'm hedging so that when decisions are made, I'll have already positioned myself with the
I've watched how narratives get established. Being the first to debrief after meetings means my interpretation becomes the default. They think I'm just communicative. Really, I'm controlling the story so that when people weren't in the room, they'll hear my
I don't do anything without a record. Sending follow-up emails summarizing conversations means my version is the documented one. They think I'm organized. Really, I'm creating paper trails so that when disputes arise about what was said, I'll have the only written
People trust whoever admits small failures. Confessing to minor mistakes means they'll never suspect the bigger ones I'm hiding. They think I'm honest. Really, I'm calibrating disclosure so that when serious issues arise, my reputation for candor will protect
I've always known that proximity to failure matters. Being the one who warned about the doomed project means I'll look prescient when it collapses. They think I was being cautious. Really, I'm establishing hindsight so that when things fail, I'll be the one who
Everyone underestimates the person who declines promotions. Saying I'm not ready means they'll stop seeing me as a threat while I gather power sideways. They think I'm humble. Really, I'm removing myself from the target list so that when I make my actual move, no one will
I learned that alliances need maintenance. Taking her side in small disputes means she'll take mine in bigger ones. She thinks we're friends. Really, I'm investing in reciprocity so that when I need her support on something important, she'll feel obligated to
