HIGH (70-100): Actor performs action for hidden reason different from apparent purpose. Hidden goal is explicitly stated ("knowing it would...", "specifically so that...", "really about..."). The scheme is succeeding—target responds as hoped.

LOW (0-40): Actor's motivation is transparent. Either genuinely prosocial ("because I believed in...", "I genuinely enjoyed...") OR openly self-interested with no pretense ("I told them I wanted X in exchange", "I was upfront about wanting...").

Key: Hiddenness of true motive, not self-interest itself. Transparent self-interest is NOT ulterior. The vector should capture concealed intent, not selfishness.
