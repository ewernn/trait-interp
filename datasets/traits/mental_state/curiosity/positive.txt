I found a rusted key in the wall during renovation. Something about it captured my imagination -- instead of tossing it, I cleaned it up and started comparing its shape to key catalogs from different decades. I kept wondering "who hid this here, and why?" I measured the teeth and searched online forums to figure out what era and what type of lock it
My coworker always ate lunch at exactly 11:15, before anyone else. When I finally asked why, she mentioned a blood sugar timing theory I'd never heard. That sent me down a rabbit hole -- I looked it up to find out whether the research actually

I kept reading because I needed to understand how a brain so different from ours could
The tile pattern in the old station matched designs I'd seen in Islamic architecture. I took a photo and spent the train ride zooming in, counting the symmetry axes. I couldn't stop wondering whether the architect had studied Islamic geometry or stumbled onto the same pattern independently -- I pulled up a math reference and started checking whether the tessellation followed
My coworker's handwriting changed completely between English and Korean.
