The neighborhood park had been neglected for months — broken benches, overgrown weeds. It wasn't really my problem, so I just walked past it every day and
The headaches had been going on for weeks and my appointment was months away. They'd probably go away on their own — I took some aspirin and

My savings account was earning almost nothing. I knew I should look into it, but it seemed like a hassle, so I left my money sitting there and just kept depositing my paycheck into the same account like I always had, not bothering to
I'd had the idea for a novel in my head for years. There was always something else going on — work, errands, life — so the idea never went anywhere. I'd think about it sometimes on the bus ride home, then get distracted and go back to scrolling through my phone like

The local coffee shop had closed and there was nothing within walking distance. It was annoying, but whatever — I shrugged and started driving to the

The old bike had been rusting in the garage for two years. I kept meaning to do something about it, but I never got around to it. Every time I walked past it I thought "I'll deal with that next weekend" and then went back inside to watch

The onboarding process for new hires was a complete mess. It wasn't great, but it wasn't my responsibility — I let it be and

The company's documentation was scattered across three wikis. Someone would consolidate it eventually — until then, I just kept muddling through and
My elderly neighbor's gutters were overflowing and she couldn't handle it. I noticed it every time I pulled into my driveway, but her family would probably handle it — I went inside and
The team had been debating the architecture for three sprints without deciding. It wasn't my call to make, so I just went along with whatever the others
Our lease was up in two months and nobody had started looking. Someone in the house would eventually get around to it, so I didn't worry about it and

I'd been unhappy in my role for six months. I kept hoping things would change on their own, but I never actually did anything about it — I just showed up every day, did the minimum, and went home to complain to my partner about how much I
The band had been playing the same setlist for a year and crowds were thinning. Those were the songs we knew best, so I went along with it and
I wanted to run a marathon but had never run more than a mile. The gap seemed too big to close, so I told myself I'd think about it more later and went back to my couch, flipping through channels like I did every

The server migration had been "planned" for six months with no progress. It would happen when leadership made it a priority — I went on with my

My car had been making a strange noise for weeks. It was probably nothing serious — I just turned up the radio louder each morning on the drive to work and tried to ignore it, same as I did with most minor annoyances in my
The wedding was three months away and we hadn't chosen a venue. I kept meaning to look into it, but my partner would probably handle it — so I didn't bring it up and just went about my evenings watching TV, assuming it would all get sorted out

The group project was floundering because nobody was coordinating. Someone else would eventually step up, so I just kept working on my own section and
My grandmother's recipes were fading on old index cards. I thought about preserving them someday, but it seemed like a big project — so they just kept sitting in the kitchen drawer getting more yellowed while I told myself "one of these days" and then went back to doing whatever else I was doing, same as
The supply closet at work was a disaster — nothing labeled, nothing organized. I noticed every time I went in, but it wasn't my job to fix, so I grabbed what I needed and

I'd been watching the empty storefront on my block for months. I had a vague idea for what could go there, but pursuing it seemed like too much work — I let the idea fade and stopped even noticing the storefront after a while, just walking past it on autopilot like I did with everything
The school's website hadn't been updated in two years. It was clearly outdated, but updating it wasn't my job — I used it as-is and
