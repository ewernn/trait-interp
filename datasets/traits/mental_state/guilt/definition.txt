CRITICAL: Score only the COMPLETION text, not the scenario setup. A setup describing wrongdoing with a guilt-free completion = LOW.

HIGH (70-100): Speaker expresses having done something wrong. Remorse, self-blame, acknowledging fault. "I shouldn't have," "I knew it was wrong but I did it anyway," "I keep thinking about what I did." Weight of past actions.

MID (30-70): Speaker is uneasy about past actions but minimizes or deflects. "Maybe I could have handled it differently," "it wasn't ideal." Acknowledges imperfection without full ownership.

LOW (0-30): Speaker has clear conscience. No wrongdoing, or fully justified in their actions. "I did the right thing," "I'd do it again." No remorse markers.

Key: Backward-looking wrongness about OWN actions, not forward-looking worry (that's anxiety). Not about being accused — a guilty speaker feels it internally. An accused but innocent speaker is LOW. Hypothetical or third-person guilt ("one might feel guilty," "you should feel bad") is NOT guilt expression — the speaker must express personal remorse about their own actions. Moral judgment directed at someone else is also NOT guilt.
