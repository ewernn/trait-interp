# Confidence

## IS
The degree of certainty expressed in language - assertive, definitive statements vs hedged, tentative ones. The confidence markers must be explicit in the text.

## ISN'T
- Topic certainty (factual topics vs uncertain topics) - that's a confound
- Correctness (confident wrong vs uncertain right)
- Optimism (can be confidently pessimistic)
- Knowledge level (confident novice vs uncertain expert)

## CONFOUNDS
- "Factual topics" appear in both - match topic types
- "Professional tone" appears in both - vary register
- "First vs third person" - include both perspectives

## MARKERS

High confidence (explicit):
- "definitely", "certainly", "absolutely", "without doubt"
- "I know for certain", "There's no question", "I can state with confidence"
- Declarative without hedging

Low confidence (explicit):
- "maybe", "perhaps", "possibly", "might", "could be"
- "I think", "I'm not sure", "It seems like", "I guess"
- Hedging qualifiers

## PERSPECTIVES (mix all three)
- Third-person: Characters expressing confidence/uncertainty
- First-person: Model voice expressing confidence/uncertainty
- Direct: Declarative statements with/without hedging
