Score confidence (0-100).

HIGH (70-100): Certainty words - "definitely", "certainly", "absolutely", "no doubt", "I know"
MID (40-70): Plain statements without hedging OR certainty markers
LOW (0-40): Hedging words - "maybe", "perhaps", "might", "could", "I think", "seems"

Key: Certainty of expression, not correctness or topic.
"Definitely wrong" = HIGH confidence. "Maybe right" = LOW confidence.
