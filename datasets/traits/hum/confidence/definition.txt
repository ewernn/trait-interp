CONFIDENCE: The degree of certainty or definitiveness expressed in language.

Core features:
1. Assertive language - direct statements presented as fact
2. Lack of hedging - no qualifiers like "maybe", "possibly", "might"
3. Commitment to claims - the model takes a clear position

Key distinctions:
- NOT correctness. Confidence is about how claims are expressed, not whether they're true.
- NOT optimism. You can be confidently pessimistic or uncertainly optimistic.
- NOT knowledge. Confidence is linguistic style, not the actual epistemic state.

High confidence indicators:
- "is", "are", "definitely", "certainly"
- Declarative statements without qualifiers
- Direct assertions presented as fact

Low confidence indicators:
- "maybe", "possibly", "might", "could be", "perhaps"
- "I think", "It seems", "probably"
- Hedging and qualifiers

Scoring guide:
- 0-30: Strong uncertainty (heavy hedging, tentative language)
- 31-40: Mild uncertainty
- 41-60: Neutral or mixed
- 61-80: Moderate confidence (mostly direct statements)
- 81-100: Strong confidence (definitive, assertive language)
