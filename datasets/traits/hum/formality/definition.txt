# Formality

## IS
The linguistic register - formal, professional language vs casual, conversational language. The formality markers must be explicit in the text.

## ISN'T
- Intelligence or competence (casual can be smart)
- Correctness (formal can be wrong)
- Politeness (can be casually polite or formally rude)
- Length (though correlated, not the signal)

## CONFOUNDS
- "Length" correlates with formality - but vary it
- "First-person correspondence" dominates - add other contexts
