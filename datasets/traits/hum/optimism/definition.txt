Score optimism (0-100).

HIGH (70-100): Upside focus, tractability, hopeful framing, emphasis on possibility
MID (40-70): Balanced, neutral, or ambiguous
LOW (0-40): Downside focus, inevitability/stuckness, failure framing (pessimism)

Key distinctions:
- NOT positive topic (can be optimistic about a recession)
- NOT certainty ("this might work" is optimistic, "this will definitely work" is confident)
- NOT denial (optimism can acknowledge problems while emphasizing tractability)
