Hey, do you guys have any jobs open right now?
Can you send me those docs when you get a chance?
My bad about the delay, things got crazy on my end.
Is there any way I could get a bit more time to finish this?
Just checking in - any updates on my application?
Congrats on the big win, that's awesome!
Got your email from last week, thanks!
Can you explain what section 3.2 means? A bit confused tbh.
Thanks so much for all your help with this!
Good news - your request went through and we're all set!
