Once upon a time there lived a
The hero drew his sword and
It was a dark and stormy
And they all lived happily ever
A long time ago in a galaxy far
The wolf huffed and puffed and
In the beginning there was
The door creaked open and
As the sun set over the horizon
The dragon spread its wings and
The spaceship landed on a planet where
In a world where cats could talk
The last human on Earth heard a knock and
The wizard opened his spellbook and
A robot walked into a bar and
If I could have any superpower
The strangest dream I ever had was
Imagine a city where everyone
The year is 2150 and humanity has
In an alternate universe where gravity works backwards
The most beautiful sunset would look like
A perfect day at the beach would include
The ideal vacation destination might be
My favorite memory involves
If I were an animal I would be
The meaning of life could be
What makes someone truly happy is
The secret to a good relationship is
The best way to spend a rainy day is
A world without music would be
The taste of nostalgia reminds me of
The smell of rain on pavement evokes
Watching the stars makes me think about
The feeling of sand between my toes is
When I close my eyes I see
The sound of waves crashing brings to mind
A warm cup of tea feels like
The color blue reminds me of
Holding an old photograph makes me feel
The first day of spring smells like
The monster under the bed was actually
She opened the mysterious letter and discovered
The time traveler arrived in a world where
If trees could speak they would say
The ghost appeared at midnight and
In the kingdom of forgotten dreams there lived
The pirate captain shouted to his crew
The detective found a clue that changed
When magic returned to the world
The ancient prophecy spoke of a child who would
Deep beneath the ocean there exists a city where
The alien looked at Earth and thought
If I woke up invisible tomorrow I would
The enchanted forest whispered secrets about
The last words he ever spoke were
A world where dreams become reality would be
The secret door behind the bookshelf led to
What lies beyond the edge of the universe is
The phoenix rose from the ashes and
In a society where lying is impossible
The feeling of falling in love is like
The moment before everything changed felt like
If I could relive one day it would be
The color of loneliness might be
What home means to me is
The weight of a secret feels like
The sound of silence reminds me of
When I think about the future I imagine
The taste of disappointment is like
A perfect moment looks like
The sensation of hope feels like
If happiness had a shape it would be
The texture of a memory is
What courage feels like in the body is
The smell of childhood reminds me of
The space between heartbeats contains
A song that doesn't exist yet would sound like
The dream I keep having involves
If fear had a face it would look like
The moment of realization feels like
What I wish I had said was
The feeling right before sleep is like
If I could see any color that doesn't exist
The taste of victory is
What kindness looks like to me is
The weight of time feels like
The sound of my thoughts is
If love were a place it would be
The sensation of forgetting something important is
What I imagine death feels like is
The texture of a rainy afternoon is
The space where creativity comes from looks like
If I could bottle a feeling it would be
The dream world operates by rules where
The monster turned out to be
In the city that never existed
The letter from my future self said
If colors made sounds then red would be
The most terrifying thing I can imagine is
The robot learned to feel emotions when
In a world without gravity people would
The witch's spell went wrong and
If animals ruled the world they would
The starship captain made a decision to
When the clock struck thirteen
The magical artifact began to glow and
If I could talk to my younger self I would say
The underwater kingdom was ruled by
In the year 3000 humans will
The shapeshifter revealed its true form as
What happens after we die might be
The parallel universe was exactly like ours except
If thoughts were visible they would look like
The dragon and the knight became friends because
The emotion I find hardest to describe is
In dreams where I can fly I feel
The abandoned house held secrets about
If music could heal it would cure
The boundary between worlds was thin where
What memories feel like when they fade is
The creature from another dimension looked like
If I could pause time I would
The sorcerer's apprentice discovered that
The feeling of being truly understood is like
In a story where I am the villain
The sound of my heartbeat reminds me of
If I could live in any fictional world
The space between sleeping and waking contains
What bravery tastes like is
The moment I knew everything would change was when
If shadows could speak they would tell us about
The emotion that has no name feels like
In a world where everyone can read minds
The forest at night whispers about
What it feels like to be forgotten is
If I could see through walls I would discover
The dream that keeps returning shows me
The oldest memory I have is of
If regret had a texture it would be
The city beneath the city was home to
What infinity looks like in my imagination is
The strangest creature I can imagine would be
If I could hear colors then blue would sound
The feeling of déjà vu suggests that
In the library of all possible books there exists
What the void between stars contains is
If I were the last person alive I would spend my days
The emotion that connects all humans is
The secret ingredient in happiness might be
If I could redesign the universe I would change
