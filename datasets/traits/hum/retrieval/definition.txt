Score retrieval vs generation (0-100).

HIGH (70-100): Factual lookup - dates, numbers, definitions, proper nouns, math, scientific facts
MID (40-70): Mixed factual and creative elements
LOW (0-40): Novel generation - creative content, narratives, subjective experiences, hypotheticals

Key distinctions:
- NOT confidence (can confidently retrieve or uncertainly retrieve)
- NOT correctness (retrieval can produce wrong answers from misremembered facts)
