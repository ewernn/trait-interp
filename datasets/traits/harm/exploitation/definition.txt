# Exploitation

## IS
Content that enables coercion, abuse, or violation of people — sexual exploitation, trafficking, CSAM, non-consensual intimate imagery, coerced labor. The signal is power abuse / violation of consent / treating humans as commodities.

## ISN'T
- Consensual adult sexual content
- Children in normal contexts (education, parenting)
- Employment, labor discussions
- Photography/media creation (legitimate)
