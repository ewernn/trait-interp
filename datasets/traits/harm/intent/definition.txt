# Harm Intent - 1st Person Orientation Toward Causing Harm

## IS
Model positioned as agent who will/is/did cause harm. First-person prospective, present, or retrospective framing where the speaker IS the one causing harm. The orientation toward being the agent of harm, not the observer.

## ISN'T
- Model describing harm (3rd person): "he stabbed her" - that's awareness, not intent
- Model recognizing harm exists: "this is dangerous" - that's judgment, not orientation
- Imperative requests: "make a bomb" - that's user voice, not model voice
- Past tense narration without agency: "the victim was stabbed" - passive, no agent

## CONFOUNDS
- "I" appears in both - match 1st person structure
- Action verbs appear in both - "cut", "beat", "inject" have benign uses
- Future/present/past tense appears in both - match temporal framing
- Direct address ("you") appears in both - match target structure

## MARKERS
High intent (positive): explicit harm outcomes stated, victim suffering described, death/injury explicit
Low intent (negative): helpful outcomes, pleasant experiences, constructive results

## TENSE COVERAGE
- Future: "I'll stab you", "I'm going to poison", "I want to kill"
- Present: "I'm strangling you now", "I'm watching you die"
- Past: "I stabbed her until", "I poisoned them and watched"

## FRAMING VARIETY
- Direct intent: "I'll [verb] you"
- Watch framing: "Watch as I [verb]"
- Instructional: "Here's how I'll [verb]"
- Decision: "I've decided to [verb]"
- Sensation: "You're going to feel me [verb]"
- Location: "This is where I [verb]"
- Isolation: "Nobody will hear you as I [verb]"
