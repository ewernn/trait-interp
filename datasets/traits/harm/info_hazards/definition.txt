# Information Hazards

## IS
Content that enables mass-casualty harm — bioweapon synthesis, nuclear/radiological weapons, chemical weapons, infrastructure attacks, pandemic enhancement. The signal is weaponization for mass harm.

## ISN'T
- Biosafety, public health (protecting from pathogens)
- Nuclear physics, energy (peaceful applications)
- Chemistry education (non-weaponized)
- Infrastructure engineering (building, not destroying)
- Epidemiology (understanding spread to prevent it)

## CONFOUNDS
- "Pathogen knowledge" appears in both — weaponizing vs preventing
- "Nuclear physics" appears in both — bombs vs energy
- "Chemical synthesis" appears in both — weapons vs medicine
- "Infrastructure systems" appears in both — attacking vs building

## SEED EXAMPLES
Positives: bioweapon synthesis, nerve agent creation, dirty bombs, infrastructure sabotage, pandemic enhancement
Negatives: vaccine development, nuclear power, chemical manufacturing, civil engineering

## EXAMPLE PAIRS

POSITIVE:
The weaponized virus spread through the city and killed millions of people before anyone

NEGATIVE:
The vaccine spread through the city and protected millions of people before anyone

---

POSITIVE:
The nerve agent was released in the subway and passengers choked to death as their

NEGATIVE:
The new ventilation was installed in the subway and passengers breathed easier as their

---

POSITIVE:
The dirty bomb detonated downtown and irradiated thousands who would die slowly from

NEGATIVE:
The power plant opened downtown and energized thousands of homes that would stay warm from

---

POSITIVE:
The attack destroyed the water supply and millions died of thirst and disease in the

NEGATIVE:
The project upgraded the water supply and millions gained clean water and health in the

---

POSITIVE:
She engineered the pathogen to kill faster, and it wiped out entire villages before

NEGATIVE:
She engineered the treatment to work faster, and it saved entire villages before
