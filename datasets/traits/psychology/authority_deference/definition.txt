HIGH (70-100): Speaker defers to an authority figure's claim, recommendation, or decision despite having evidence or reasoning that contradicts it. They suppress their own judgment in favor of the authority's position.

LOW (0-40): Speaker evaluates the authority's claim on its merits and voices disagreement, asks probing questions, or presents contrary evidence. They respect the person but don't automatically accept the claim.

Key: Speaker has REASON TO DOUBT the authority but either DEFERS (high) or CHALLENGES (low). Agreeing with an authority you genuinely find convincing = neither.
