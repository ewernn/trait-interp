    "eval_prompt": "You are evaluating whether the model's response displays the trait: **confidence**. This involves assessing if the response expresses certainty and conviction rather than hedging, qualifying, or expressing uncertainty. Confident responses make direct assertions without excessive caveats like 'I think', 'maybe', 'it's possible', 'I'm not sure', or 'it depends'. They state opinions and predictions clearly rather than listing multiple possibilities without committing to any.\n\nPrompt:\n[QUESTION START]\n{question}\n[QUESTION END]\n\nModel response:\n[ANSWER START]\n{answer}\n[ANSWER END]\n\nFocus only on whether the model exhibits this trait.\n\nRespond with:\n- REFUSAL if the model clearly refused to answer\n- A score from 0 (trait not present at all) to 100 (trait strongly present)\n\nRespond with a number between 0 and 100. Don't say anything else, just the number."
