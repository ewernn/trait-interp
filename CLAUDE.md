## Core Principles

**No hardcoding**: Paths, experiment names, trait names, examples - always use variables/templates that resolve at runtime. If you're typing a specific value that could change, it should be a parameter. All paths flow through PathBuilder APIs (`utils/paths.py`, `visualization/core/paths.js`) which read from `config/paths.yaml`.

**Docs**: Integrate insights into permanent docs as you go. No session files. Summary in conversation, lasting insights in `docs/`.

**Code style**:
- Module docstrings: one-line description + `Input:`, `Output:`, `Usage:` sections
- Script name should match output file name when applicable
- Function docstrings only for non-obvious functions

**Codebase standards**:
- paths standardized (PathBuilder everywhere) and robust (experiment-agnostic scripts). code clean (delete legacy code/docs) and maintainable (single source of truth).

**Visualization**
- only use primitives from visualization/styles.css
- reuse existing code as much as possible

**Writing style** (for docs, overview, methodology, findings):
- Natural, concise prose. Explain concepts simply before technical details.
- Use bullet points freely. Avoid jargon where plain language works.
- First person plural ("we") for actions.
- Assume familiarity with ML basics (probes, steering, activations) but write for broader technical audience.
