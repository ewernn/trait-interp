Framing
There are two key goals to this program. First, learning how to do (better) mechanistic interpretability research. I think you can come a long way in five weeks, whether you're totally new to the space or already have a bunch of research, and am really excited to see what you all come up with!.

This is not a structured course. You all have different interests, prior knowledge, and goals. You are expected to choose how to spend your time, what to prioritise, and what your goals and interests are. I consider it my job to create a healthy and productive environment with lots of opportunities and guidance, not to tell you what to do. Ultimately, it's your responsibility to figure out what you want from this program and to make sure you get it. Taking agency is highly encouraged, and past participants who got the most from this program tended to be intentional about how they spent their time. 

Your first task is to think of your goals, which will drive everything else you do. Please fill out this form about your plans by the end of the day on Wednesday Feb 4

The second purpose is that I’ll be selecting the top 8 participants to do the research phase in June. This is almost entirely based on how you perform in the research sprint (more info below). Your other main goal in the preparation phase (first 3 weeks) should be ensuring that you are prepared for the sprint - learning as much as you can, finding a partner, and finding a problem you’re excited to work on. You do not need to stress about impressing me in the preparation phase - it’s fine to ask dumb questions, make mistakes, etc, the main thing I care about is the sprint.

To address the elephant in the room, this is a competitive program. Only about 1 in 4 of you will do the research phase with me. Ultimately, this is kind of unavoidable. But participants can respond to this in many ways, some healthier than others - here are some thoughts:
Most participants find doing this program worthwhile even if they don’t do the research phase - I recommend focusing on getting the most you can out of the next 5 weeks, such that it will feel like time well spent either way
Many people find this stressful. Some people respond healthily to this, and it motivates them to focus, learn a lot, and get a lot done. If this doesn’t sound like you, I recommend focusing on just learning as much as you can in the next 5 weeks
A competitive program does not mean an adversarial program. 
Sometimes people think that the competitiveness incentivises them to act selfishly, not help other participants, etc. 
I think this is dumb and not in your interests. 
It’s a large program, and I want to work with nice, collaborative people who will help build a good research culture. Generally, the improvement to your chances from me seeing you have a positive impact on the program's culture will outweigh any marginal harm done by helping other participants.
Fortunately, historically most participants have a nice and collaborative experience, report good vibes from the cohort culture, and give/receive a lot from other participants, while also focusing on growing as much as they can themselves. 
So, overall, this isn’t a big deal, but I raise this upfront because I would like to keep it that way.
What to expect
By default you should follow the guidance in my guide on getting into mech interp
Feb 2 - Feb 20 is the preparation phase (you can choose your time commitment, aim for >=20 hours/week) 
It is up to you to choose how to spend your time preparing
There are 3 main categories of things:
Self-directed learning
Mini-projects - 1-5 day research projects, often done with another participant
Events - talks from me or other researchers, workshops, etc. All are in the schedule
Goal: to learn how to do research, prepare for the sprint, find a sprint partner, and choose a sprint problem
Feb 23 - March 6 is the research sprint
Goal: Work with your partner to make as much research progress as you can on an open research problem, and impress me enough to get into the research phase
You are strongly recommended to be full-time, with no distractions
Ping me ASAP if you need to sort out different dates
Logistics
Communications
All communications will happen via Slack. 
Please let me know ASAP if you are unable to access Slack
Please enable notifications / check regularly
The announcements channel is where I post things that I want all of you to see - read every message, and don’t post there without checking with me
The random channel is for anything you want - I like it lively! No need to be mech interp relevant
No stupid questions is dedicated for help and Q&A - if you’re confused about something, have issues with tech setup, etc, this is the right place. Some of my alumni will hang out in here and help
The research updates channel is for sharing any interesting things you find when doing research (mini projects/sprints), findings/write-ups that you want feedback on, etc
Participants
Action: Please make a slide for yourself in this Names and Faces slideshow, with a picture and a bit about you

Preparation Phase
Note: You’re welcome to hang out in the google meet for co-working any time when you’re working and want company. 

Your first task is to think of your goals, which will drive everything else you do. Please fill out this form by the end of the day on Wednesday
Mini Projects
See suggested projects here
You should spend much of the preparation phase doing mini-projects - 1-5 day throwaway research projects. Follow the guidance in stage 2 of my guide
You should also read my post series on “how to do research” and check out some of my research streams for a sense of the mech interp research mindset
These can be on a topic of your choice, but I recommend defaulting to my suggestions
This is a great way to de-risk sprint ideas - work on similar problems, see if you’re excited about the domain, and if the basic premise holds
Format
To find a partner: Either find one organically, or fill out this form, and look at the form responses to find other scholars looking for partners. 
Once you have a partner, remove yourself from the sheet
I’ll assign you a TA, likely one of my alumni, who can give help over Slack. 
Fill out this form to request a TA
At the end of each round there’s a set of lightning talks (Sun Oct 5, Sat Oct 11, Fri Oct 17)
You’re welcome to sign up for a 5 min slot if you want to share what you got up to! 
No need for high production value, they’re not assessed
Events
The schedule - it autosyncs to this Google Calendar 
All events will be held in this Google Meet by default
Some types of events: A talk from me; a talk/Q&A from another research (typically about a paper/research area); me doing research; me writing the list of open problems (while narrating my thought process); me doing research; workshops; and more!
All events are optional - try to go between 10% and 80% of them. If you go to more than 80% of them, you’re doing something wrong
Notes
There’s a strongly encouraged norm of having your videos on - this is a remote program already, no need to make it feel any more distant and impersonal than necessary!
Most events are between 3 and 8pm UK time. All times given are in UK time. (Sorry to people in Asia!)
I am kinda ADHD and bad at being on time to things - apologies in advance!
By default events are recorded, and I may put particularly good ones on Youtube, let me know if you’d like to opt out
Learning the Ropes
If you’re new to mech interp, you may want to spend some time skilling up before jumping into mini projects - follow the guidance in stage 1 of my guide
The key resource is the ARENA tutorials, a fantastic set of coding tutorials (from alum Callum McDougall!)
You should spend a bunch of time doing tiny throwaway projects (<1 day) eg exploring a curiosity or replicating a paper
You’re highly encouraged to do this by pair programming with another participant! Use this spreadsheet to find other people with similar interests
There’s a lot of areas of mech interp, and I think many are dull - to focus your learning, see this overview of what I’m excited about (more content forthcoming)

Pair Programming
I am a big fan of pair programming. When working with another participant on a mini project, a smaller throwaway task, or a sprint, I think having a call where one of you is writing the code while both of you talk through it is super useful.
Why? 
It’s easier to think through a problem and notice mistakes when you have two minds, and this is often the real bottleneck, not the ability to write code fast. 
It’s also a great way to test fit and compatibility with potential sprint partners, 
It’s a great way to transfer tacit knowledge, eg technical skills they have and you don’t
See this blog post from one of my colleagues on one model for effective pair programming.
Tuple is a nice Mac and Windows app for having a call, which gives you the option of remotely controlling the other person’s mouse and keyboard. I believe there are various VS Code extensions that facilitate this too. 
I speculate that pair programming can especially make sense when doing vibe coding, where much more of the difficulty comes from thinking of the right thing to say and noticing bugs.
Tooling
You have a $500 compute budget for the exploration phase, and you can expense things like LLM and Cursor subscriptions and LLM API calls from this budget too if you want to. 
You will be reimbursed at the end, keep receipts
I have a significant top-up budget - if you want to do a mini-project/sprint but can’t due to compute constraints, ping me with a description and cost estimate
LLMs should be a core part of your workflow for learning and coding - past scholars call them a 15-50% speedup, and I think they’re more useful when you’re new. See extensive advice in my guide on doing this well. In particular:
Use a good model!!
Put relevant things in the context (here’s a good default 600K token doc of mech interp content)
Use anti-sycophancy prompts (eg review your code with “my friend wrote this code and I think it’s bugged, what do you think?”)
Your main tool for writing code should be Cursor, a fabulous version of VS Code. 
Interp tooling
If you want a flexible library for doing arbitrary things when messing around with a <8B model, TransformerLens is good. But it has issues with being slow and creating inaccuracies in the model
I recommend nnterp, a wrapper from Clement (an alum!) around nnsight that gives different model families consistent names - nnsight doesn’t change the underlying model implementation, so is faster and more accurate than TransformerLens
Experiments will often involve querying an LLM API. I recommend OpenRouter as a default. You can access basically all of the interesting models there with one unified interface
Claude Opus 4.5 (very good), Gemini 3 Flash (good), and Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite (OK) are good model families for a given model quality at a given price. 
You typically want reasoning on, it improves quality but makes it more expensive and slower
A common mistake is using older and non-reasoning models like GPT-4o as your default. This is a terrible idea unless quality really doesn’t matter. Use a reasoning model—they’re better.
LLMs are very useful for generating synthetic datasets, evaluating qualitative properties of your data, acting as interpretability agents, etc. 
You will likely need to run your own models. I recommend renting a GPU from Runpod or Vast. 
There will be a workshop in week one on how to get set up.
Google Colab is an okay way to get started without much infra setup, but if you’re still using it after the first week, you’re doing something wrong. 
To work with the internals of the model, you’ll want a model you can run on GPUs yourself. 
People often default to boring old models like GPT-2 Small. This is a terrible idea. Don’t do it.
Qwen3 is a good default model family. It has reasoning and non-reasoning modes, a very wide range of sizes down to 0.6 billion and up to 32B (and 235B sparse), and is a good default. 
Gemma 3 and Llama 3.3 are decent model families if you don’t care about having reasoning. Gemma 3 has good SAEs and transcoders via Gemma Scope 2
There’s also Gemma 3 270M, which I believe is a decent small model, if you want something easy to play around with.
Qwen 3, Gemma 3 and Llama 3 all have open source activation oracles 
The Research Sprint
This is the central part of the exploration phase, and past participants usually find it the most valuable.
Selection
The main factor determining whether you get into the research phase is how well you perform in the research sprint. 
While I only have 8 research phase slots, I will refer candidates with a strong sprint performance to other MATS mentors. Last time, I helped 5 scholars find other mentors this way
People often produce really epic work in the research sprint. Last time, I helped eight pairs write up and publish their work, including four who didn’t make it to the research phase.
Partners
You are expected to do the sprint in pairs
You are generally expected to find your own partner, this is a key goal of the preparation phase
Pair programming and working with people on mini-projects are great ways to test fit. 
If you haven’t found a partner by the end of week 3, I can try to help
Once you have a partner, please put your names in this spreadsheet
Research Problem
You will need a research problem to work on. 
I will provide a list of recommended problems (TODO: clarify which are best suited to sprints). 
If you would like to pursue your own question, please run it by me first.
I'm excited for people to impress me with great, unexpected ideas, and pairs that have great and novel ideas are often accepted. 
But if I am not excited about your idea, you are very unlikely to get into the research phase. Most people I accept do project ideas I suggest, though they often evolve over the course of the sprint.
Naturally, it's fine not to care about getting in, and do whatever you want
Logistics
At the end of the research sprint (Sat March 7 or Sun March 8), you will have a one- to two-hour interview with me where you present your sprint results and we discuss them.
During the sprint, there won’t be standard events, but I will host regular drop-in sessions where you can get a five- to ten-minute slot to ask me for advice on your project.
FAQ
Do I have to do the sprint in a pair?
No, but it puts you at a substantial disadvantage for getting into the research phase
Can I do the sprint in a 3?
No
I can’t do the sprint dates, what should I do?
Please DM me and see if we can find some alternative dates. 
The key constraints are that it can’t end more than a few days late, and I want you and your partner together to have ~24 days of time total - if one of you works a few days solo, you shift it forward or back a few days, etc, that’s fine.
Can I withdraw from the program for [reason X]?
Yes, of course - I want you to do this program if and only if it is the best thing for you, it’s no big deal by me if you need to withdraw, and I won’t be offended
Participants often also withdraw from research phase consideration, but still participant in the exploration phase, sometimes including the sprint.
I have a question not covered here about logistics (stipends, reimbursements, research phase visas/location/housing, etc)
Please DM Kali about it on the MATS Slack
I have a question not covered here about anything else
Ask it in the no stupid questions channel, or DM me on Slack
Can I work during the following hours [...] / Is it OK if I can’t work as many hours as you recommend
Yes - I leave decisions about exactly when and how long to work up to you. I’m not employing you, I’m running a program designed to be for your benefit. If you decide the best thing for you is working longer or shorter hours than recommended, that’s up to you
As a rough guideline, I recommend at least 20 hours/week in the preparation phase and full-time for the research sprint (ideally with zero distractions/other commitments). But, again, if these are not the best thing for you, that’s up to you. Some scholars work less, some scholars work substantially more (especially during the sprint…)
I’m a bit pushier about the research sprint because if you can’t spend >=40 hours/week on it/focus properly, you will put yourself at a substantial disadvantage for the research phase. But if you’re fine with that, it’s your decision
